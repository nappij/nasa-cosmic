     This two dimensional convolution code program is invoked
by typing

                2dcc  input_filename

     It will generate an output file with file extention
".lst".  The result of each stage is reported.


     The input file contains the value of d1 and d2.  Then
each element of arrays A and B is listed by row.  It is 
free format, but it must be in order  A[0][0] A[0][1] ...
A[0][d2] A[1][0] ... A[d1][d2]  B[0][0] B[0][1] ...
B[d1][d2].

     If the first column of a line is a "*", the whole line 
is regarded as a comment.  It is free to put comments
anywhere in the file.
