NASA was one of the first labs to share the code developed internally; it was done through a web portal called COSMIC at the University of Georgia. COSMIC was closed down in 1998, but I found a set of boxed cdrom from the long-gone Pacific Hi-Tech with a more or less complete set of source code directories.
It contains mainly fortran 77 codes, some of which may be of interest to engineers.
Packages were obtained "as is" by pacific hi-tec, and it seems that they were distributed as public domain after payment of copying costs.
