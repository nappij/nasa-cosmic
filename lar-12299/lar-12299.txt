 NSEG- A SEGMENTED MISSION ANALYSIS PROGRAM FOR LOW AND HIGH SPEED AIR-
CRAFT

( AEROPHYSICS RESEARCH CORP. )

     NSEG was developed to perform rapid aircraft mission analyses. It is
based upon the use of approximate equations of motion whose form varies with
the type of flight segment. Flight segments considered are takeoff, accel-
erations, climbs, cruises, descents, decelerations, and landings. Layered
atmosphere options are available. The program can also be used for flight
envelope mapping. NSEG provides the capability to analyze aircraft mis-
sions from low to hypersonic speeds.

     Realistic and detailed vehicle characteristics are input to NSEG to
permit accurate mission analysis. NSEG allows engine scaling so as to fit
the design under analysis. NSEG contains several approximate flight path
optimization capabilities based on Rutowski energy-like criteria for con-
sidering minimum time or fuel flight segments and maximum range segments
during climb or descent. Takeoff and landing analysis is based on the Air
Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory DATCOM method of high lift aerodynamic
modelling. There are three main atmosphere options available; the 1962
U.S. Standard atmosphere, a stratified atmosphere model, and an external
atmosphere model supplied by the user. The stratified atmosphere model re-
quires the input of the number of layers (maximum 25), altitudes, tempera-
tures, and pressures. The mission specification is open-ended in that the
upper limit on the number of flight segments to be included in a mission pro-
file can be increased with a simple program change. Input consists of ve-
hicle characteristic data, data to specify details of the mission, and se-
lection of program options. Output can be printer-generated tabular data
or contour plots on a Calcomp plotter, CRT, or Houston plotter.

     NSEG is written in FORTRAN IV and Assembler, and has been implemented
on a CDC 6000 Series computer with a central memory requirement of approxi-
mately 130K octal 60 bit words and is overlayed. This program was developed
in 1977.
