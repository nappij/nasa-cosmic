 TRAJEC- NUMERICAL TRACING OF ELECTRON TRAJECTORIES

( SCIENCE APPLICATIONS, INC. )

     The TRAJEC computer program was developed as a tool to aid in the anal-
ysis and design of various electron imaging systems. TRAJEC can integrate
the path of a relativistic electron through a region of non-uniform, static
electromagnetic fields to an accuracy of one micrometer in ten centimeters.
A fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with error estimation (a Kutta-Merson
procedure) is used for integration of the motion equations. The force eval-
uation uses a third-order Legendre interpolation of the electrical poten-
tial. The program is designed to easily interface with various forms of
user defined electric potentials and magnetic fields. TRAJEC may be imple-
mented interactively so that the analyst might freely experiment with com-
binations of trajectories, thereby gaining insight into the aberrations
inherent in the imaging system under study. Several methods are provided
for analyzing the imaging properties of the device under study. The trajec-
tory of a single electron injection from any point with arbitrary initial
velocity may be studied. Lines of electrons may be studied to test system
linear imaging properties. TRAJEC also allows for studies of Monte Carlo
point sources of electrons to simulate the characteristic emmissive prop-
erties of photo-cathode materials and their effect on the images produced.
TRAJEC has been used to evaluate and modify designs for the Digicon image
tube, an imaging device for use on the NASA Space Telescope.

     The TRAJEC program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch or interactive
execution and has been implemented on a PDP DEC-10 computer with a central
memory requirement of approximately 14K of 36 bit words, and on a CDC 6000
series machine in 37K (octal) of 60 bit words. TRAJEC has also been utilized
on PDP-11, CYBER 70, and CYBER 170 series machines. TRAJEC was developed in
1979.
