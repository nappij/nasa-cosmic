Text Mode displays the fields which are to be edited.  Some of the fields for
the bullet chart may not fit on the screen at one time so the screen will
scroll through different areas of the chart when editing a large bullet chart.
To change the information in the fields, type the new information and it will
replace the old information.  To insert characters in the middle of the field,
press the insert key and what is typed will be inserted.  What is on the screen
when a function key or the return key is pressed is what will be saved.
