for the number of the slide to insert.  This means whatever number is entered
the slide at that line and below in the show where the cursor was will be
pushed down one line with the last line (10) being deleted and a new line will
be placed at that number.  If a return is pressed when asking for the number,
the line on which the cursor was located will be inserted to the show. To not
