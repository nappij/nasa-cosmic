insert a low-level.  To insert a low-level, place the cursor on the field which
is to be above the new low-level.  Press F3 and a blank line will be created on
which the new low-level can be entered.  To insert the first low-level place
the cursor on the associated mid-level before pressing F3.

When entering data in the organization chart for the first time, inserting will
automatically be done when pressing the carriage return.  If the new field is
not desired, press the return key before entering any characters.
