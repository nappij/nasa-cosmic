prompt asks for the date of the symbol to be deleted.  The cursor must be on
the line that the deletion is to occur, but this can be done before or after
the delete key is pressed.  Instead of entering a date, the cursor can also be
used to point at the symbol to be deleted.  If a bar and a triangle are at the
same place, the triangle will be deleted, not the bar.  To stop the delete
function once it has begun, press F1(Cancel).
