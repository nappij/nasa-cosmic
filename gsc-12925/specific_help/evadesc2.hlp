        EAC  : the estimated cost at completion,                               
        ACV  : at completion cost variance,  ACV = BAC - EAC,                  
        CV   : the cost variance,             CV = BCWP - ACWP,                
        %CV  : the cost variance percentage, %CV = CV / BCWP,                  
        SV($): the scheduled variance in $ ,    SV($) = BCWP - BCWS,           
        %SV  : the scheduled variance percentage, %SV = SV($) / BCWP,          
        SV(M): the scheduled variance in months,                               
                        SV(M) = SV($) * no. of months / BCWP,                  
        CPI  : the cost performance index,       CPI = BCWP / ACWP,            
        SPI  : the scheduled performance index,  SPI = BCWP / ACWP,            
        %CPL : the percentage of completion,    %CPL = BCWP / BAC,             
        %SPT1: the percentage of BAC spent,    %SPT1 = ACWP / BAC,             
        %SPT2: the percentage of EAC spent,    %SPT2 = ACWP / EAC,             
        TCPI : to completion performance index,                                
                        TCPI = ( BAC - BCWP ) / ( EAC - ACWP ).
