option has been selected, the prompt warns that the directory will be replaced.
If downloading just one file, the directory will not be replaced, but whatever
is in HOSTMAIL will be deleted and the file recieved will be there.  When
recieving all the slide shows the directory will be rewritten.  Whatever was
sent to TELEMAIL will be recieved.  If recieving is desired, press F2 to
continue.  Otherwise, press F1(Cancel) to return to the Slide Show Main menu.
