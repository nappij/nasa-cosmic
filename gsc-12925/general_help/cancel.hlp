anytime when printing or in a slide show when multiple charts are being 
processed.  Also cancel is used to back up one step in case a key was
accidentally pressed, such as with the exit key.  The cancel key is also used
to skip the saving of a chart and allow for maintenance of the directory to
be performed.

The cancel key can not reverse something which has already been done, such as
if something is deleted cancel cannot undelete it.
