the Main Menu the format menu is displayed.  The format options can be changed
or any of the function keys can be pressed to continue creating the new chart.
Pressing the F4 key from the Main Menu has the effect of not displaying the 
sample chart, but continuing as if an F6 was pressed at the sample chart.
This is only to save the experienced user the time of drawing the sample chart
since he already knows what the chart looks like.

To download a file from the database on the host, the F1 option from the Main
Menu must be pressed.  This is also to save the experienced user the time of
answering that prompt.






To continue, press the desired function key.

        F8  Return to Previous Menu
 
        F10 Exit from Help

Press F8 to return to the last menu screen or F10 to leave the help mode
