prompt asks for the date at which to start the bar.  The date can be entered in
the dd/mm/yy format or if the cursor is on the exact location, just pressing
a return will use the date at that location.  Remember the cursor must be on
the line where the bar is to be drawn.  After the first date is entered, the
prompt asks for the ending date which is entered in the same manner as the
first.  The bar will then draw and will be unfilled.  Use F5(Fill Bar) to fill
it.

To change a bar which has already been drawn, place the cursor on the bar and
press return.  The old starting date will be displayed with the cursor at the
beginning.  Change the starting date and press return.  The old ending date
will be displayed with the cursor at the end of the bar.  Change the ending
date and press return.  The new bar will be drawn.
