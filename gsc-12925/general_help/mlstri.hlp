the prompt will ask for the date of the triangle.  Enter the date in the
dd/mm/yy format or if the cursor is at the desired location, press return.
Remember the cursor must be on the same line as the triangle to be inserted.
After the date is entered, the prompt will ask for the optional number which
will be placed in the center of the triangle if given.  After this prompt has
been answered, the triangle will appear on the screen unfilled.  To fill the
triangle use F7(Fill Triangle).
