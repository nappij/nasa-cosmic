Plot is used to save a chart in the format used by the Slide Show Program
(VDM).  This format is necessary to combine different type charts into one
slide show.  The plot key is accessed from the View Screen.  After pressing the
plot key, a temporary file is created.  After this file is done, the prompt
asks for the new format's filename which is saved in a different directory than
the charts.  This directory is maintained using the Slide Show Program, not the
chart program.  After the name and description are given, the file is saved and
the user is returned to the View Screen.  To return to the View Screen without
saving the chart press F1(Cancel) at the first prompt.

The available function keys are the same as the save menu except when
F1(Cancel) is pressed, the second save menu used for maintenance is not
displayed.  To recieve more help on those keys, press F9(More Help) to display
the Save Menu help.



To continue, press the desired function key.
