an example of what the chart will look like.  To skip the sample chart, use
F4 from the Main Menu.  When viewing ths sample chart the keys which are not
valid are ignored, so to continue from the sample chart, press F6 to change
the format options or F2 to start entering the text.  When the Main Screen is
redisplayed, the new chart will be shown.

For the Earned Value Analysis, Trend Analysis, Progress and Level of Effort,
and Travel and Training charts, the first thing that appears when creating a
new chart is the prompt asking if you want to retrieve the data from the
database on the host.  This is the database that is stored on the host for
these charts and is not the same as the chartbase which is stored on the local
diskette.  When using the Upload/Download option from the Main Menu, the
chartbase is used.  If using the database is desired, answer Y to the prompt.
The database file is converted to a chartbase file and downloaded into HOSTMAIL
where it can be reviewed using F2 of the Main Menu.

To continue, press the desired function key.
