for the number of the slide to remove.  This means whatever number is entered
the slide at that line in the show where the cursor was will be removed from
that show.  If a return is pressed when asking for the number, the slide where
the cursor was located will be removed from the show.  When a slide is removed,
the slides listed under it will all move up one line.  To not remove a slide
press F1(Cancel).
