asks for the number of the slide which is to be moved.  After the number is
entered the prompt will ask for the number of the location of where to move the
slide.  After the second number is entered the slide is removed from the
present position and inserted in the new position.  Pressing a return or
F1(Cancel) will cancel the move.  When the slide is moved the slide will first
be taken from the location it was, all the slides in between will be shifted,
and the slide will be placed in the new location.  No slide will be deleted.
