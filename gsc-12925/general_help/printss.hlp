to make sure the printer is ready.  The slide show which is chosen will be
shown on the screen one at a time and printed as soon as it finishes drawing.
If one chart is chosen, it will act like a slide show of one slide.  To not
print a slide show once print has been pressed, press F1(Cancel).  Any other
key will start the printing.  To stop a print once it has begun press
F1(Cancel) and if the slide show is to be stopped, press F1 again immediately
after the first.  Sometimes printers have large buffers so the printing may
take a while to stop.
