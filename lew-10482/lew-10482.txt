 PLOT3D- DRAWING THREE DIMENSIONAL SURFACES

( NASA Lewis Research Center )

     PLOT3D is a package of programs to draw three-dimensional surfaces of
the form z = f(x,y). The function f and the boundary values for x and y are
the input to PLOT3D. The surface thus defined may be drawn after arbitrary
rotations.

     However, it is designed to draw only functions in rectangular coordi-
nates expressed explicitly in the above form. It cannot, for example, draw
a sphere. Output is by off-line incremental plotter or online microfilm
recorder. This package, unlike other packages, will plot any function of
the form z = f(x,y) and portrays continuous and bounded functions of two in-
dependent variables. With curve fitting; however, it can draw experimental
data and pictures which cannot be expressed in the above form.

     The method used is division into a uniform rectangular grid of the
given x and y ranges. The values of the supplied function at the grid points
(x, y) are calculated and stored; this defines the surface. The surface is
portrayed by connecting successive (y,z) points with straight-line seg-
ments for each x value on the grid and, in turn, connecting successive (x,z)
points for each fixed y value on the grid. These lines are then projected by
parallel projection onto the fixed yz-plane for plotting.

     This program has been implemented on the IBM 360/67 with on-line CDC
microfilm recorder.
