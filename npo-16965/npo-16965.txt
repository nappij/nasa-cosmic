 STAR- A SIMPLE TOOL FOR AUTOMATED REASONING SUPPORTING HYBRID APPLICA-
TIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     The Simple Tool for Automated Reasoning program (STAR) is an interac-
tive, interpreted programming language for the development and operation
of artificial intelligence (AI) application systems. STAR provides an en-
vironment for integrating traditional AI symbolic processing with func-
tions and data structures defined in compiled languages such as C, FORTRAN
and PASCAL. This type of integration occurs in a number of AI applications
including interpretation of numerical sensor data, construction of intel-
ligent user interfaces to existing compiled software packages, and cou-
pling AI techniques with numerical simulation techniques and control sys-
tems software. The STAR language was created as part of an AI project for
the evaluation of imaging spectrometer data at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab-
oratory.

     Programming in STAR is similar to other symbolic processing languages
such as LISP and CLIP. STAR includes seven primitive data types and associ-
ated operations for the manipulation of these structures. A semantic net-
work is used to organize data in STAR, with capabilities for inheritance of
values and generation of side effects. The AI knowledge base of STAR can be
a simple repository of records or it can be a highly interdependent associa-
tion of implicit and explicit components. The symbolic processing environ-
ment of STAR may be extended by linking the interpreter with functions de-
fined in conventional compiled languages. These external routines inter-
act with STAR through function calls in either direction, and through the
exchange of references to data structures. The hybrid knowledge base may
thus be accessed and processed in general by either side of the application.

     STAR is initially used to link externally compiled routines and data
structures. It is then invoked to interpret the STAR rules and symbolic
structures. In a typical interactive session, the user enters an expres-
sion to be evaluated, STAR parses the input, evaluates the expression, per-
forms any file input/output required, and displays the results.

     The STAR interpreter is written in the C language for interactive ex-
ecution. It has been implemented on a VAX 11/780 computer operating under
VMS, and the UNIX version has been implemented on a Sun Microsystems 2/170
workstation. STAR has a memory requirement of approximately 200K of 8 bit
bytes, excluding externally compiled functions and application-dependent
symbolic definitions. This program was developed in 1985.
