 OWL-1200 VIDEO TERMINAL EMULATOR FOR THE IBM PERSONAL COMPUTER

( BOEING SERVICES INTERNATIONAL )

     An OWL-1200 video terminal emulator has been written for the IBM Per-
sonal Computer. The OWL-1200 is a simple user terminal with some intelli-
gent capabilities. These capabilities include screen formatting and block
transmission of data. Several programs, such as Systonetics' VIS1ON soft-
ware for hierarchial scheduling, require this type of terminal. The emula-
tor software provides the IBM Personal Computer with all of the capabili-
ties of the OWL-1200 terminal. Even those features which are implemented in
hardware on the OWL-1200 are fully provided by the emulator software.

     This emulator is written in Pascal and Assembler for the IBM Personal
Computer operating under DOS 1.1. Minimum machine requirements include one
disk drive, a serial communication board, a color graphics adapter, and 128
Kb of memory. This emulator was developed in 1983.
