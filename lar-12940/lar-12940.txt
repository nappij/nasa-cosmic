 OPTIM- A VERTICAL PROFILE WHICH MINIMIZES AIRCRAFT FUEL BURN OR DIRECT
OPERATING COST

( ANALYTICAL MECHANICS ASSOCIATES )

     The OPTIM computer program was developed to generate optimum vertical
profiles for turbojet powered aircraft. Specifically, OPTIM generates a
profile of altitude, airspeed, and flight path angle as a function of range
between a given set of origin and destination points for particular models
of transport aircraft. The profile may be optimized in the sense of mini-
mizing fuel or time or in minimizing the direct operating cost expressed
as a combination of fuel and time. Inputs to the program include the ver-
tical wind profile, the aircraft takeoff weight, and the aircraft engine
and aerodynamic characteristics. The optimum vertical flight profile is
generated by calculating the airspeed and thrust required to minimize the
Hamiltonian at specific energy increments.

     The OPTIM program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has
been implemented on a CDC 6000 series computer with a central memory re-
quirement of approximately 140K (octal) of 60 bit words. The OPTIM program
was developed in 1981.
