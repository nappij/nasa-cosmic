 CLIPS - C LANGUAGE INTEGRATED PRODUCTION SYSTEM

( NASA Johnson Space Center )

     The C Language Integrated Production System, CLIPS, is a shell for de-
veloping expert systems. It is designed to allow artificial intelligence
research, development, and delivery on conventional computers. The pri-
mary design goals for CLIPS are portability, efficiency, and functional-
ity. For these reasons, the program is written in C. CLIPS meets or outper-
forms most micro- and minicomputer based artificial intelligence tools.

     CLIPS is a forward chaining rule-based language. The program contains
an inference engine and a language syntax that provide a framework for the
construction of an expert system. It also includes tools for debugging an
application. CLIPS is based on the Rete algorithm, which enables very ef-
ficient pattern matching. The collection of conditions and actions to be
taken if the conditions are met is constructed into a rule network. As facts
are asserted either prior to or during a session, CLIPS pattern-matches the
number of fields. Wildcards and variables are supported for both single and
multiple fields. CLIPS syntax allows the inclusion of externally defined
functions (outside functions which are written in a language other than
CLIPS). CLIPS itself can be embedded in a program such that the expert sys-
tem is available as a simple subroutine call.

     Advanced features found in CLIPS version 4.3 include an integrated mi-
croEMACS editor, the ability to generate C source code from a CLIPS rule
base to produce a dedicated executable, binary load and save capabilities
for CLIPS rule bases, and the utility program CRSV (Cross-Reference, Style,
and Verification) designed to facilitate the development and maintenance
of large rule bases.

     Five machine versions are available. Each machine version includes
the source and the executable for that machine. The UNIX version includes
the source and binaries for IBM RS/6000, Sun3 series, and Sun4 series com-
puters. The UNIX, DEC VAX, and DEC RISC Workstation versions are line ori-
ented. The PC version and the Macintosh version each contain a window-
ing variant of CLIPS as well as the standard line oriented version. The
mouse/window interface version for the PC works with a Microsoft compatible
mouse or without a mouse. This window version uses the proprietary CURSES
library for the PC, but a working executable of the window version is pro-
vided. The window oriented version for the Macintosh includes a version
which uses a full Macintosh-style interface, including an integrated edi-
tor. This version allows the user to observe the changing fact base and rule
activations in separate windows while a CLIPS program is executing. The IBM
PC version is available bundled with CLIPSITS, The CLIPS Intelligent Tu-
toring System for a special combined price (COS-10025). The goal of CLIP-
SITS is to provide the student with a tool to practice the syntax and con-
cepts covered in the CLIPS User's Guide. It attempts to provide expert di-
agnosis and advice during problem solving which is typically not available
without an instructor. CLIPSITS is divided into 10 lessons which mirror the
first 10 chapters of the CLIPS User's Guide. The program was developed for
the IBM PC series with a hard disk. CLIPSITS is also available separately as
MSC-21679.

     The CLIPS program is written in C for interactive execution and has
been implemented on an IBM PC computer operating under DOS, a Macintosh and
DEC VAX series computers operating under VMS or ULTRIX. The line oriented
version should run on any computer system which supports a full (Kernighan
and Ritchie) C compiler or the ANSI standard C language. CLIPS was devel-
oped in 1986 and Version 4.2 was released in July of 1988. Version 4.3 was
released in June of 1989.
