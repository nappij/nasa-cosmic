 MISLIFT- AERODYNAMIC LIFT ON WING-BODY COMBINATIONS AT SMALL ANGLES OF
ATTACK IN SUPERSONIC FLOW

( NASA Langley Research Center )

     Two separate and distinct theories are incorporated in this computer
program to estimate the lift-induced pressures existent on a wing-body com-
bination. These are (1) the second-order shock-expansion theory, which is
used to obtain the lifting pressures on the body alone at small angles of at-
tack, and (2) the linear-theory integral equations, which is used to evalu-
ate the lifting pressures induced by the wing.

     These equations relate the local surface slope at a point on the lift-
ing surface to the pressure differential at the point and the influence of
the pressures upstream of the point. The numerical solution of these equa-
tions is effected by treating the wing-planform as a composite of elemental
rectangles and applying summation techniques to satisfy the necessary in-
tegral relations.

     Most of the input required by this program is involved with the de-
scription of the missile planform geometry. The output consists of the com-
puted value of the lifting pressure slope (the differential pressure coef-
ficient per degree angle of attack) for each of the elements in the planform
array. A force and moment summary is presented for the configuration under
consideration.
