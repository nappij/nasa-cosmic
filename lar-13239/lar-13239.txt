 COREL/W12SC3- PROGRAMS FOR SUPERSONIC WING DESIGN AND ANALYSIS

( GRUMMAN AEROSPACE CORP. )

     COREL and W12SC3 are two computer programs useful in the aerodynamic
design and analysis of wings for supersonic maneuvering. Both programs
use the Super Critical Conical Camber (SC3) concept, in which high super-
sonic lift coefficients are obtained by controlling cross flow develop-
ment. COREL (Conical Relaxation) solves the nonlinear full potential equa-
tion for a spanwise section of a wing in the crossflow plane and corrects
the result for any nonconical geometry. W12SC3 applies linear theory panel
methods to compute solutions for a wing-body configuration. The programs
are not restricted to supersonic maneuvering cases, but are useful for many
design, analysis, and optimization applications.

     COREL computes the mixed subsonic/supersonic crossflow that devel-
ops on supersonic wings with high lift coefficients at Mach numbers nor-
mal to shock waves of 1.3 or less. The bow and crossflow shocks are captured
as part of the solution. The initial aerodynamic solution is produced on
a crude grid and is then reiterated. A finer mesh is then mapped, keeping
the bow shock within the boundary of the new computed crossflow. The input
geometry can be specifically defined or calculated in COREL using Craidon
bicubic spline patches.

     W12SC3 combines source and vortex panel singularity distributions for
calculating the linear theory estimate of the configuration aerodynamics.
The user can specify Woodward II calculations for arbitrary body models or
Woodward I calculations for an interference shell that approximates actual
body shape. The Carlson correction for supersonic linear theory wing cal-
culations is applied at wing control points. If desired, COREL will produce
conical panel pressure data for further processing by W12SC3. W12SC3 can
perform the following aerodynamic functions: 1) full analysis, 2) full de-
sign, 3) full optimization, 4) mixed design-analysis, and 5) mixed design-
optimization. Results from W12SC3 include wing camber distribution, sur-
face velocities, pressure coefficients and drag.

     COREL and W12SC3 are written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and have
been implemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with a central memory
requirement of 252K (octal) of 60 bit words. These programs were developed
in 1983.
