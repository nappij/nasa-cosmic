 PAFAC- PLASTIC AND FAILURE ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITES

( NASA Langley Research Center )

     The increasing number of applications of fiber-reinforced composites
in industry demands a detailed understanding of their material properties
and behavior. A three-dimensional finite-element computer program called
PAFAC (Plastic and Failure Analysis of Composites) has been developed for
the elastic-plastic analysis of fiber-reinforced composite materials and
structures. The evaluation of stresses and deformations at edges, cut-
outs, and joints is essential in understanding the strength and failure
for metal-matrix composites since the onset of plastic yielding starts
very early in the loading process as compared to the composite's ultimate
strength. Such comprehensive analysis can only be achieved by a finite-
element program like PAFAC. PAFAC is particularly suited for the analysis
of laminated metal-matrix composites. It can model the elastic-plastic be-
havior of the matrix phase while the fibers remain elastic. Since the PAFAC
program uses a three-dimensional element, the program can also model the
individual layers of the laminate to account for thickness effects.

     In PAFAC, the composite is modeled as a continuum reinforced by cylin-
drical fibers of vanishingly small diameter which occupy a finite volume
fraction of the composite. In this way, the essential axial constraint of
the phases is retained. Furthermore, the local stress and strain fields are
uniform. The PAFAC finite-element solution is obtained using the displace-
ment method. Solution of the nonlinear equilibrium equations is obtained
with a Newton-Raphson iteration technique. The elastic-plastic behavior
of composites consisting of aligned, continuous elastic filaments and an
elastic-plastic matrix is described in terms of the constituent proper-
ties, their volume fractions, and mutual constraints between phases indi-
cated by the geometry of the microstructure. The program uses an iterative
procedure to determine the overall response of the laminate, then from the
overall response determines the stress state in each phase of the composite
material. Failure of the fibers or matrix within an element can also be mod-
eled by PAFAC.

     PAFAC is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been imple-
mented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with a segmented memory require-
ment of approximately 66K (octal) of 60 bit words. PAFAC was developed in
1982.
