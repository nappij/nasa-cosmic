 GENOPTICS- A GENERAL OPTICAL SYSTEMS EVALUATION PROGRAM

( NASA Goddard Space Flight Center )

     The General Optical Systems Evaluation Program, GENOPTICS, was de-
veloped as an aid for the analysis and evaluation of optical systems that
employ lenses, mirrors, diffraction gratings, and other geometrical sur-
faces. The GENOPTICS evaluation is performed by means of geometrical ray
tracing based upon Snell's law. The GENOPTICS program can provide for the
exact ray tracing of as many as 800 rays through as many as 40 surfaces.
These surfaces may be planar, conic, toric, or polynomial shaped lenses,
mirrors, and diffraction gratings. Each surface may be tilted about as many
as three axes and may be decentered. Surfaces having bilateral symmetry may
also be analyzed. GENOPTICS provides for user-oriented input and for a wide
range of output for the evaluation of the optical system being analyzed.

     GENOPTICS provides a wide range of features for the optical system ana-
lyst. GENOPTICS performs paraxial ray tracing and computation of the third
order aberrations including aspheric contribution. Graphical output can
be generated for spot diagrams, radial energy distributions, and modula-
tion transfer functions, for each object point and each color. Sag tables
may be generated for any rotationally symmetric surface, with options to
obtain the sag differences from a reference sphere in units of lengths or
wavelengths. Statistics and plots of ray intercepts with any surface in the
system may be obtained for use in vignetting analysis and beam distribution
analysis. Afocal systems can be examined with image statistics generated
in terms of tangents of angles with respect to the optical axis. For exact
ray tracing, a ray pattern at the entrance pupil can be specified as a rect-
angular or polar grid, where each ray samples an equal amount of area, or as
a pattern where each ray samples an equal amount of solid angle for a finite
object. This latter pattern is useful in radiometric work.

     Input to GENOPTICS includes program control statements, system defi-
nition data, surface data, and task data. Multiple cases may be examined in
a single run. Output includes printed and graphical results. The user can
specify which portions of an analysis are to be printed. Optional printout
includes system data, surface-to-surface printout of each ray, modulation
transfer function values, radial energy distribution values, and parax-
ial ray data including aberrations. GENOPTICS is coded to generate plot-
ted output for a ZETA plotting system but should be readily adapted to other
plotting systems.

     The GENOPTICS program is written in FORTRAN 77 and has been implemented
on an IBM 370 series and DEC VAX series computer with a central memory re-
quirement of approximately 220K of 8 bit bytes. GENOPTICS was developed in
the mid 1970's and last updated in 1984.
