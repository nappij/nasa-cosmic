 ANALYSIS OF AIRCRAFT MOTIONS

( NASA Ames Research Center )

     This program was developed by Ames Research Center, in cooperation
with the National Transportation Safety Board, as a technique for deriv-
ing time histories of an aircraft's motion from Air Traffic Control (ATC)
radar records. This technique uses the radar range and azimuth data, along
with the downlinked altitude data, to derive an expanded set of data which
includes airspeed, lift, attitude angles (pitch, roll, and heading), etc.
This technique should prove useful as a source of data in the investigation
of commercial airline accidents and in the analysis of accidents involving
aircraft which do not have onboard data recorders (e.g., military, short-
haul, and general aviation).

     The technique used to determine the aircraft motions involves smooth-
ing of raw radar data. These smoothed results, in combination with other
available information (wind profiles and aircraft performance data), are
used to derive the expanded set of data. This program uses a cubic least-
square fit to smooth the raw data. This moving-arc procedure provides a
smoothed time history of the aircraft position, the inertial velocities,
and accelerations. Using known winds, these inertial data are transformed
to aircraft stability axes to provide true airspeed, thrust-drag, lift, and
roll angle. Further derivation, based on aircraft dependent performance
data, can determine the aircraft angle of attack, pitch, and heading angle.
Results of experimental tests indicate that values derived from ATC radar
records using this technique agree favorably with airborne measurements.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV to be executed in the batch mode,
and has been implemented on a CDC 6000 series computer with a central memory
requirement of 64k (octal) of 60 bit words.
