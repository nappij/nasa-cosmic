     This directory contains source code for the SUN/UNIX
distribution of the STAR interpreter.  The code is divided among
several files, summarized briefly below.  Following this, a set
of guidelines is given for compiling and linking the files into
an executable module for the STAR interpreter.

  stardefs.h  -- definitions used throughout an application,
  starcomm.h  -- definitions used locally within the interpreter,

  starcode.c  -- main source code for the STAR interpreter,
  starbifs.c  -- definitions for most built-in functions in STAR,
  starplus.c  -- built-in functions which are machine-dependent,
  starhack.c  -- machine-dependent initialization code for STAR,

  starini1.c  -- initialization data for the STAR knowledge base,
  starini2.c  --   "
  starini3.c  --   "
  starini4.c  --   "
  starini5.c  --   "
  starini6.c  --   "

  starlink.c  -- tables for linking external functions into STAR,
  starutil.c  -- utility routines for accessing & altering UNITs,

  samplec.c   -- sample external routines defined in C,
  samplef.f   -- sample external routines defined in FORTRAN,
  samplep.p   -- sample external routines defined in PASCAL.

----------

     The following commands may be used to compile the source
files.  Each compilation produces an object file of the same
name as the source file, but with the trailing label replaced
with ".o".  ("%" indicates the SUN/UNIX prompt).

      % cc -c starcode.c
      % cc -c starbifs.c
      % cc -c starplus.c
      % cc -c starhack.c

      % cc -c starini1.c
      % cc -c starini2.c
      % cc -c starini3.c
      % cc -c starini4.c
      % cc -c starini5.c
      % cc -c starini6.c

      % cc -c starlink.c
      % cc -c starutil.c

      % cc -c samplec.c
      % f77 -c samplef.f
      % pc -c samplep.p

     Following this, the command file "LINK" may be invoked
to link the object files together into a single executable
file.

      % LINK

     The executable file produced is called "star" and may
be called directly from the system level as follows.

      % star
