 CARE3MENU- A CARE III USER FRIENDLY INTERFACE

( NASA Langley Research Center )

     CARE3MENU generates an input file for the CARE III program. CARE III
is used for reliability prediction of complex, redundant, fault-tolerant
systems including digital computers, aircraft, nuclear and chemical con-
trol systems. The CARE III input file often becomes complicated and is not
easily formatted with a text editor. CARE3MENU provides an easy, interac-
tive method of creating an input file by automatically formatting a set of
user-supplied inputs for the CARE III system. CARE3MENU provides detailed
on-line help for most of its screen formats.

     The reliability model input process is divided into sections using
menu-driven screen displays. Each stage, or set of identical modules com-
prising the model, must be identified and described in terms of number of
modules, minimum number of modules for stage operation, and critical fault
threshold. The fault handling and fault occurence models are detailed in
several screens by parameters such as transition rates, propagation and
detection densities, Weibull or exponential characteristics, and model
accuracy. The system fault tree and critical pairs fault tree screens are
used to define the governing logic and to identify modules affected by com-
ponent failures. Additional CARE3MENU screens prompt the user for output
options and run time control values such as mission time and truncation val-
ues. There are fourteen major screens, many with default values and HELP
options. The documentation includes: 1) a users guide with several exam-
ples of CARE III models, the dialog required to input them to CARE3MENU,
and the output files created; and 2) a maintenance manual for assistance in
changing the HELP files and modifying any of the menu formats or contents.

     CARE3MENU is written in FORTRAN 77 for interactive execution and has
been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer operating under VMS. This pro-
gram was developed in 1985.
