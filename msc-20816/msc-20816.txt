 ARIES- AIRCRAFT ROLL-OUT ITERATIVE ENERGY SIMULATION PROGRAM

( ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP. )

     The ARIES program analyzes aircraft brake performance during rollout.
The program simulates a three degree of freedom rollout after nose gear
touchdown. The amount of brake energy dissipated during landing determines
the life expectancy of brake pads. ARIES incorporates brake pressure, ac-
tual flight data, crosswinds, and runway characteristics to calculate the
following: 1) brake energy used during rollout for up to four independent
brake systems, 2) time profiles of rollout distance, velocity, decelera-
tion, and lateral runway position, and 3) all aerodynamic moments on the ve-
hicle. ARIES can be adapted for modelling most landing aircraft during un-
powered rollout. Optimum braking procedures can be developed with ARIES
to minimize brake deterioration while staying within specified lengths of
runway. ARIES has been used to evaluate several Shuttle Orbiter brake pad
failures.

     After the input of initial runway and landing conditions, ARIES uti-
lizes three simulation models to evaluate the rollout at given time in-
tervals. The brake force simulation requires tire and brake information
along with actual flight data. The equations of motion allow force and mo-
ment balances to be calculated. The aerodynamic effects are computed, in-
cluding lift, drag, axial and normal forces, and roll, pitch, and yaw mo-
ments. The various aerosurface effects are obtained from interpolation of
the Rockwell Aero Sciences Group Design Data Book tables. The output is in
both printed and plotted form. ARIES iterates the calculations until the
computed forward velocity is below three knots.

     ARIES is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch execution (interactive usage
is possible, but high external core memory requirements may limit its prac-
tice) and has been implemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with a cen-
tral memory requirement of 64K of 60 bit words, with up to an additional 460K
of 60 bit words for storing the aerodynamic coefficient table interpolation
subroutines. ARIES was developed in 1984.
