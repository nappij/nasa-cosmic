 SPAM- SPECTRAL ANALYSIS MANAGER

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     The Spectral Analysis Manager (SPAM) was developed to allow easy qual-
itative analysis of multi-dimensional imaging spectrometer data. Imag-
ing spectrometers provide sufficient spectral sampling to define unique
spectral signatures on a per pixel basis. Thus direct material identifi-
cation becomes possible for geologic studies. SPAM provides a variety of
capabilities for carrying out interactive analysis of the massive and com-
plex datasets associated with multispectral remote sensing observations.
In addition to normal image processing functions, SPAM provides multiple
levels of on-line help, a flexible command interpretation, graceful error
recovery, and a program structure which can be implemented in a variety of
environments. SPAM was designed to be visually oriented and user friendly
with the liberal employment of graphics for rapid and efficient exploratory
analysis of imaging spectrometry data.

     SPAM provides functions to enable arithmetic manipulations of the
data, such as normalization, linear mixing, band ratio discrimination, and
low-pass filtering. SPAM can be used to examine the spectra of an individ-
ual pixel or the average spectra over a number of pixels. SPAM also supports
image segmentation, fast spectral signature matching, spectral library us-
age, mixture analysis, and feature extraction. High speed spectral signa-
ture matching is performed by using a binary spectral encoding algorithm to
separate and identify mineral components present in the scene. The same bi-
nary encoding allows automatic spectral clustering. Spectral data may be
entered from a digitizing tablet, stored in a user library, compared to the
master library containing mineral standards, and then displayed as a time-
sequence spectral movie. The output plots, histograms, and stretched his-
tograms produced by SPAM can be sent to a lineprinter, stored as separate
RGB disk files, or sent to a Quick Color Recorder.

     SPAM is written in C for interactive execution and is available for
two different machine environments. There is a DEC VAX/VMS version with a
central memory requirement of approximately 242K of 8 bit bytes and a ma-
chine independent UNIX 4.2 version. The display device currently supported
is the Raster Technologies display processor. Other 512 x 512 resolution
color display devices, such as De Anza, may be added with minor code modi-
fications. This program was developed in 1986.
