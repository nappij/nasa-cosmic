 TRANSIENT RESPONSE OF ABLATING AXISYMMETRIC BODIES INCLUDING THE EFFECTS
OF SHAPE CHANGE

( NASA Langley Research Center )

     A computer program has been developed to analyze the transient re-
sponse of an ablating axisymmetric body, including the effect of shape
change. The governing differential equation, the boundary conditions for
the analysis on which the computer program is based, and the method of so-
lution of the resulting finite-difference equations are discussed in the
documentation.

     Some of the features of the analysis and the associated program are (1)
the ablation material is considered to be orthotropic with temperature-
dependent thermal properties; (2) the thermal response of the entire body
is considered simultaneously; (3) the heat transfer and pressure distribu-
tion over the body are adjusted to the new geometry as ablation occurs; (4)
the governing equations and several boundary-condition options are formu-
lated in terms of generalized orthogonal coordinates for fixed points in a
moving coordinate system; (5) the finite-difference equations are solved
implicitly; and (6) other instantaneous body shapes can be displayed with a
user-supplied plotting routine.

     The physical problem to be modeled with the analysis is described by
FORTRAN input variables. For example, the external body geometry is de-
scribed in the W, Z coordinates; material density is given; and the stagna-
tion cold-wall heating rate is given in a time-dependent array. Other input
variables are required which control the solution, specify boundary condi-
tions, and determine output from the program. The equations have been pro-
grammed so that either the International System of Units or the U. S. Cus-
tomary Units may be used.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been
implemented on a CDC 6000 Series computer. This program was developed in
1972.
