     QPLOT is a device-independent, interactive graphics library for
the VAX computer.  While the system was designed around the graphics
capability of the Tektronix 4109 terminal, it has been implemented on
a range of terminals with widely differing capabilities.  In addition
to graphics, the QPLOT library provides complex math capabilities and
filters the user input for many commands, thus freeing the programmer
from implementing his own commands to control the QPLOT options. 

     The current version is written in Pascal for the VAX.  A number
of non-standard features of the VAX Pascal compiler were used, and
some effort will be required to convert the program to run on a
different machine.  All features used have Ada equivalents.
