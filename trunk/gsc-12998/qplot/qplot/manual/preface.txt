                     How to use the QPLOT manuals


     There are several manuals that describe the QPLOT system.  A list
of the subroutines and how they are called may be found in the QPLOT
Reference Manual (Volume 1).  The QPLOT User's manual (Volume 2)
describes the action of the commands that are implemented in the QPLOT
user input handler.  This manual may be incorporated into manuals for
application programs, either directly into the body, as an appendix,
or perhaps as a separate manual. 

     Additional manuals describing the various application programs
that use QPLOT will also be produced as needed.  For example, the
program WORM uses the QPLOT library to produce simple plots.  WORM
is described in Volume W1.
