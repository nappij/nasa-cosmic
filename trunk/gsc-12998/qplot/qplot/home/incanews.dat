                           WELCOME TO INCA

      We have fixed a few bugs in the Nearness/Closeness area, including
      one that caused incomplete cancellation of slightly imaginary 
      factors.  The default values for nearness and closeness have
      been swapped, back to the way they were in INCA 2.0x.  I.e.:

                       Nearness            = 1e-6
                       Closeness to zero   = 1e-12

      This is Version 3.13, with a new feature allowing GOTO's and
      IF-THEN-ELSE's in source files, hopefully without screwing up 
      anything else too much.  Working on the documentation.
      IF you want to help alpha-test this, give me a call.

      Report any problems that are found to user QPLOT immediately!!!!!
