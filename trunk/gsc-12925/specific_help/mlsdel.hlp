chart will allow the user to delete a milestone id.  To delete a milestone id

desired number or if the cursor is on the desired milestone just press the
return key.  The desired milestone will be deleted and all the milestones below
will be shifted up one field with a blank field being added to the end.  The
shift will also affect the bars and triangles on those lines by moving them up.
