Text Mode displays the fields which are to be edited.  Some of the fields for
the work breakdown structure chart may not fit on the screen at one time so the
screen will scroll through different areas of the chart when editing a large
chart.  To change the information in the fields, type the new information and
it will replace the old information.  To insert characters in the middle of the
field, press the insert key and what is typed will be inserted.  What is on the
screen when a function key or the return key is pressed is what will be saved.
