insert a mid-level.  To insert a mid-level, place the cursor on the field which
is to be next to the new mid-level.  Press F3 and a blank line will be created
on which the new mid-level can be entered.  To insert the first mid-level place
the cursor on the last staff, or, if there are no staff, on the last deputy,
or, if neither exist, on the top-level before entering F3.  To insert any other
mid-level, the cursor can be on any of the low-levels of the previous mid-level
or on the mid-level itself.

When entering data in the organization chart for the first time, inserting will
automatically be done when pressing the carriage return.  If the new field is
not desired, press the return key before entering any characters.
