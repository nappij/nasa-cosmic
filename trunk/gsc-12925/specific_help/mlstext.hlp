The milestone text mode is different than any of the other text modes since the
milestone text can not fit on one page.  Because of this, the milestone text
mode has been broken up into two screens, Header and Milestone/Footnote
with the Header screen appearing as soon as the F2(Text) key is pressed.  To
recieve information on these two screens, press the appropriate key as shown
below.
When a number field is edited in text mode, it will be shifted to the left to
make editing easier and then shifted to the right when done.

To obtain help for any of the following subjects,  press the function key next
to the desired subject.

        F10 Exit from Help
