annotation.  After the revise key is pressed, the user has a chance to move the
cursor onto the annotation which is to be revised.  When the cursor is on an
annotation, the annotation will appear reversed.  When the annotation to be
revised is reversed, press return.  To not revise an annotation make sure the
cursor is not on an annotation when pressing the return key.  After the
annotation is chosen the annotation will appear near the bottom of the screen.
After changing the annotation to be as desired, press the return key and the
revised annotation will be displayed on the chart where the old one was.

When revising an annotation, there may be extra characters displayed at the
end of the revised annotation.  Do not worry about this since it will be fixed
when leaving the annotation mode.
