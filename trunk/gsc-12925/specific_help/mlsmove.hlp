chart will allow the user to move a milestone id.  To move a milestone id
the cursor must first be on a milestone id.  When the move key is pressed,
the prompt asks for the number of the milestone to be moved.  Enter the 
desired number and the prompt will then ask for the new location.  Enter the
new location and the desired milestone will be moved and all the milestones
in between will be shifted one field with no field being deleted.  The
shift will also affect the bars and triangles on those lines by moving them.
To stop the move once it has begun, press F1(Cancel).
