COMMENT | INITEK is an 8088 routine to initialize the serial interface
                for the Tektronix 4662 plotter.  The 4662 requires
                a baud rate of 1200, even parity, seven bit words with
                two stop bits.

COMMENT | CKAUX uses the BIOS routine (INT 14H) in order to poll the

COMMENT | RDYLIN is an 8088 routine to read the data off the interface
                from the 4662.  If no data has been sent, the routine
                returns control to the caller.  If a DC3 has been sent,
                RDYLIN waits until the 4662 sends a DC1, indicating
                it is ready to receive more data.

COMMENT | Procedure crite(c: char);

          CRITE is intended to be called from Pascal.  The character c is
          found in location BP+06.  The character is written by WRAUX,
          then the plotter is polled via RDYLIN to see if it is ready to
          accept more data.
