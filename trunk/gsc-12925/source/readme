This is a suggested way of compiling these charts :

        1. Copy *.int files from disk # 1 to a disk containing the
           Pascal compiler.

        2. Compile *.asm files on disk #1 with a Macro Assembler.

        3. Copy *.imp from disk #1 to a blank formatted disk.

        4. Compile *.imp on this disk by placing the Pascal disk in
           A: and this disk in B: with the default set to drive B:.

        5. Copy *.obj from all disks to a disk containing the Linker
           and the Pascal library.

        The remaining steps must be done for each chart.

        6. Copy all files beginning with the same first three letters
           from disk #2 or 3 to a blank formatted disk.

        7. Compile *.imp and *.pas on this disk using the same method as 4.

        8. Copy *.obj from this disk to another blank formatted disk.
           (This is due to a shortage of space.)

        9. When linking from this disk, place Linker in A: and the disk
           from 8. in B:. All obj files must be included starting with
           the asm files ( except for graphpak, which should not be
           included for any chart on disk #3 or for NSQ on disk #2).
           The following is an example of a linker batch file for the
           milestone chart :

                a:dsasm a:vbpas a:vbasm a:dspas a:sfpas a:sfasm+
                a:fonts a:font1 a:font2 a:font3+
                a:vdmpas a:vdmgen+
                mls mlsaltd mlsexec+
                a:getparam a:option a:utility a:dialog+
                a:display a:execute a:ldb a:alterl, mls, con;

       10. When linking is done the execution file has been created,
           but to run it, the CTL file must be on the default disk.
