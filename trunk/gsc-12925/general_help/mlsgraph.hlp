The Graphics Mode for the milestone chart allows entering bars and triangles
to describe each milestone id.  When in graphics mode, the crosshair cursor
shows the location on the chart.  Whenever doing any operation on a graphics
symbol, the cursor must be on the same milestone line.  When entering a date
for any of the entries, it must be in the format day/month/year with a maximum
of 2 digits for each division.
