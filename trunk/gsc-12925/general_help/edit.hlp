moving from field to field to moving character to character.  When the edit
key is first pressed, the prompt for F2 changes from Edit to End Edit.  This
is to allow the user to know that the left or right arrow keys will move to the
previous or the next character.  If F2 is pressed while the End Edit is 
displayed the prompt for F2 will show Edit again allowing the user to know that
the left and right arrow keys will move the cursor to the left or right one
field.  Anytime the cursor is moved from one field to the next the left and
right arrow keys will be reset to move from field to field and the F2 prompt
will display Edit.
