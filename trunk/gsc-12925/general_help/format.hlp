The format menu allows changing of the current formats which will be used to
draw the chart.  The formats are saved with each chart so that each time the
chart is viewed, it looks the same.  To change the default options enter the
new value and it will replace the old value.  To move from field to field, use
the up and down arrows or the return key.  When two columns are used, the down
arrow moves from the bottom of the one column to the top of the other and the
up arrow moves from the top of the one column to the bottom of the other.  The
return key works the same as the down arrow.  The right arrow is used to obtain
the next character in the default value and the left arrow or backspace is used
to remove the last character in the default value.  When any key is pressed the
values which are being displayed are the values used to draw the chart.
