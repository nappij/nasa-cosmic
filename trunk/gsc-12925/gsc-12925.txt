 OAP- OFFICE AUTOMATION PILOT GRAPHICS DATABASE SYSTEM

( NASA Goddard Space Flight Center )

     The Office Automation Pilot (OAP) Graphics Database system offers the
IBM PC user assistance in producing a wide variety of graphs and charts. OAP
uses a convenient database system, called a chartbase, for creating and
maintaining data associated with the charts, and twelve different graph-
ics packages are available to the OAP user. Each of the graphics capabili-
ties is accessed in a similar manner. The user chooses creation, revision,
or chartbase/slide show maintenance options from an initial menu. The user
may then enter or modify data displayed on a graphic chart. The cursor moves
through the chart in a "circular" fashion to facilitate data entries and
changes. Various "help" functions and on-screen instructions are avail-
able to aid the user. The user data is used to generate the graphics por-
tion of the chart. Completed charts may be displayed in monotone or color,
printed, plotted, or stored in the chartbase on the IBM PC. Once completed,
the charts may be put in a vector format and plotted for color viewgraphs.

     The twelve graphics capabilities are divided into three groups:
Forms, Structured Charts, and Block Diagrams. There are eight Forms avail-
able: 1) Bar/Line Charts, 2) Pie Charts, 3) Milestone Charts, 4) Resources
Charts, 5) Earned Value Analysis Charts, 6) Progress/Effort Charts, 7)
Travel/Training Charts, and 8) Trend Analysis Charts. There are three
Structured Charts available: 1) Bullet Charts, 2) Organization Charts, and
3) Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Charts. The Block Diagram available is an
N x N Chart. Each graphics capability supports a chartbase. The OAP graph-
ics database system provides the IBM PC user with an effective means of man-
aging data which is best interpreted as a graphic display.

     The OAP graphics database system is written in IBM PASCAL 2.0 and as-
sembler for interactive execution on an IBM PC or XT with at least 384K of
memory, and a color graphics adapter and monitor. Printed charts require
an Epson, IBM, OKIDATA, or HP Laser printer (or equivalent). Plots require
the Tektronix 4662 Penplotter. Source code is supplied to the user for mod-
ification and customizing. Executables are also supplied for all twelve
graphics capabilities. This system was developed in 1983, and Version 3.1
was released in 1986.
