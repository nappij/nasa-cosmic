                      FSD VAX Implementation
                     ************************

    This is the Flexible Spacecraft Dynamics Program-V, modified
  to run on the VAX 11/780 VMS version 3.7 . FSD was written by AVCO 
  and modified to run on the VAX by ODSI. 
      
    To install FSD, create a directory "[FSD]" and define FSDHOME as 
  the FSD directory. The tape is a backup. 
    BACKUP MF:FSD.BCK/SELECT = [...] [...]/REWIND
  will restore the tape.

    For questions concerning how to create an input data file see 
  "A user's guide to the FLEXIBLE SPACECRAFT DYNAMICS PROGRAM-V".
    
    The executable image is called FSD.EXE . The image will look 
  for the data in FOR004.DAT . An example of a data set can be 
  found under EXAMPLE.DAT . An example of FSD output can be found 
  under EXAMPLE.OUT .

    To use FSD, you first assign the input data file to FOR004, 
  then run FSD :

    ASSIGN EXAMPLE.DAT FOR004
    RUN FSD

    To run as a sub-process, you type :

    ASSIGN EXAMPLE.DAT FOR004
    RUN FSD/OUTPUT=EXAMPLE.OUT
 
    To run batch, you type :

    SUBMIT SUBMITFSD/PARAMETER=([FSD]EXAMPLE.DAT)     

    SUBMITFSD.COM is a very basic command procedure. It looks for
  the FSD executeable in FSDHOME, and needs the directory the data
  file is in as well as the name of the data file.

    The command procedures needed to run FSD batch through a card
  reader can be found under AACARDS.TXT and RUNFSD.COM .

    The command procedure to compile and link up the subroutines
  is called COMLINK.COM . COMLINK.COM is in [FSD.SOURCE]

    NOTE : If modifications are made to any of the FORTRAN subroutines
  they should be recompiled using the /NOF77 option.(Except for RANDO,
  SUBLIB and REMTIM) There is a PASCAL routine called LIBRARY.PAS . If
  your system does not have a PASCAL compiler the object code is supplied.
  Edit the "PAS/NOWARNING LIBRARY" line out of COMLINK.COM .
