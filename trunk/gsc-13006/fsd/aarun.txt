             FLEXIBLE SPACECRAFT DYNAMICS PROGRAM V
            *****************************************


    This is the Flexible Spacecraft Dynamics Program V, modified
  to run on the VAX 11/780 VMS 3.7 . FSD was written by AVCO and
  modified to run on the VAX by ODSI. 
      
    For questions concerning how to create an input data file see 
  "A user's guide to the FLEXIBLE SPACECRAFT DYNAMICS PROGRAM-V".
    
    The executable image is called FSD.EXE . The image will look 
  for the data in FOR004.DAT . An example of a data set can be 
  found under EXAMPLE.DAT . An example of fsd output can be found 
  under EXAMPLE.OUT .

    To run fsd, you first assign the input data file to FOR004, 
  then run FSD.

    ASSIGN EXAMPLE.DAT FOR004
    RUN FSD

    To run as a sub-process, you type :

    ASSIGN EXAMPLE.DAT FOR004
    RUN FSD/OUTPUT=EXAMPLE.DAT
 
    To run batch, you type :

    SUBMIT SUBMITFSD/PARAMETER=([FSD]EXAMPLE.DAT)     

    SUBMITFSD.COM is a very basic command procedure. It looks for
  the FSD executeable in FSDHOME, and needs the directory the data
  file is in as well as the name of the data file.

    The command procedures needed to run FSD batch through a card
  reader can be found under AACARDS.TXT and RUNFSD.COM .
