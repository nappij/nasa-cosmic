 A FAST POLYNOMIAL TRANSFORM PROGRAM WITH A MODULARIZED STRUCTURE

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     This program utilizes a fast polynomial transformation (FPT) al-
gorithm applicable to two-dimensional mathematical convolutions. Two-
dimensional convolution has many applications, particularly in image pro-
cessing. Two-dimensional cyclic convolutions can be converted to a one-
dimensional convolution in a polynomial ring. Traditional FPT methods de-
compose the one-dimensional cyclic polynomial into polynomial convolu-
tions of different lengths. This program will decompose a cyclic polyno-
mial into polynomial convolutions of the same length. Thus, only FPTs and
Fast Fourier Transforms of the same length are required. This modular ap-
proach can save computational resources. To further enhance its appeal,
the program is written in the transportable 'C' language.

     The steps in the algorithm are: 1) formulate the modulus reduction
equations, 2) calculate the polynomial transforms, 3) multiply the trans-
forms using a generalized fast Fourier transformation, 4) compute the in-
verse polynomial transforms, and 5) reconstruct the final matrices using
the Chinese remainder theorem. Input to this program is comprised of the
row and column dimensions and the initial two matrices. The matrices are
printed out at all steps, ending with the final reconstruction.

     This program is written in 'C' for batch execution and has been imple-
mented on the IBM PC series of computers under DOS with a central memory re-
quirement of approximately 18K of 8 bit bytes. This program was developed
in 1986.
