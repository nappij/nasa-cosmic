 DETERMINATION OF FLOW FIELD IN A NONEQUILIBRIUM SHOCK LAYER ABOUT A
SMOOTH SYMMETRIC BODY TRAVELING AT HYPERSONIC SPEEDS USING AN INVERSE
TECHNIQUE

( NASA Langley Research Center )

     An approximate inverse solution is presented for the nonequilibrium
flow in the inviscid shock layer about a vehicle in hypersonic flight. The
method is based upon a thin-shock-layer approximation and has the advantage
of being applicable to both subsonic and supersonic regions of the shock
layer. The relative simplicity of the method makes it ideally suited for
programming on a digital computer with a significant reduction in storage
capacity and computing time required by other more exact methods. Compari-
son of nonequilibrium solutions for an air mixture obtained by the present
method is made with solutions obtained by two other methods. Additional
cases are presented for entry of spherical nose cones into representative
Venusian and Matrian atmospheres. A digital computer program written in
FORTRAN language is presented that permits an arbitrary gas mixture to be
employed in the solution. The effects of vibration, dissociation, recom-
bination, electronic excitation, and ionization are included in the pro-
gram.
