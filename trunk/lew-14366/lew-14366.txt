 MULTICOMPONENT CONVECTIVE DEPOSITION RATES

( ANALEX CORPORATION )

     A wide variety of engineering applications including chemical coat-
ing of metals, solid state electronics device fabrication, filtration,
aircraft icing, corrosion and fouling of gas turbine blades, and heat
exchangers- deal with vapor and particle capture, either to exploit or
suppress it. A comprehensive but tractable convective diffusion deposi-
tion rate theory exists based on the assumption of a multicomponent 'chemi-
cally frozen' boundary layer (CFBL). The theory makes full use of available
transport coefficient and property information. CFBL is applicable under
conditions of multicomponent vapor transport, and is capable of simultane-
ously dealing with "heavy molecule" particle transport. This CFBL theory
has been incorporated into a simple computer program for calculating alkali
sulfate deposition rates. With code changes, this program should be adapt-
able to other deposition problems.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV (IBM Level H) for batch execution
and has been implemented on an IBM 370 computer with a central memory re-
quirement of approximately 40K of 8 bit bytes. This program was developed
in 1984.
