	EXIT will exit the CARE3MENU program.  The exit function
	does not perform an explicit save of any information
	which the user may have input using the ENTER function,
	the STORE function MUST BE EXPLICITLY CALLED for this
	to happen.  An exit without a store will result in the
	loss of any model which has been entered but not yet
	stored.
