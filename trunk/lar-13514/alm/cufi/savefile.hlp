	The STore command will save a CARE III model in the file,
	if a model has been entered.  This menu is requesting the
	name of the file in which the model should be saved.  The
	file name should be no more than nine characters in length.
	The file will be created with a ".DAT" extension, unless
	you specify an extension.  STORE will clear the model in
	flag, allowing you to enter another model.
