 MISER2- MISTUNING EFFECTS ON TURBOFAN CASCADES

( NASA Lewis Research Center )

     In the development of modern aircraft turbofan engines, the aeroelas-
tic stability and response of bladed-disk assemblies have been among the
most difficult problems encountered. The study of stability and response
in these assemblies is complicated by the presence of small differences be-
tween the individual blades, known as mistuning. The Mistuning Effects on
Turbofan Cascades program, MISER2, was developed to improve the basic un-
derstanding of the effects of mistuning on aeroelastic stability and re-
sponse.

     The MISER2 program calculates the flutter boundaries and aeroelas-
tic response of a cascade of arbitrarily mistuned airfoils. It is based on
a formulation incorporating incompressible subsonic and supersonic, un-
steady, two-dimensional aerodynamic theories. Each blade is modeled as
a two degree-of-freedom oscillator having inertial coupling between the
bending and torsional motions. It is possible to consider any type of un-
coupled bending and torsional frequencies, damping ratios, mass ratios,
and elastic axis and center of gravity positions. Special cases which can
be treated by MISER2 include: tuned and mistuned cases; uncoupled bending
and uncoupled torsion cases; and the tuned coupled bending-torsion case.

     MISER2 was developed for the IBM 370 with VM/SP and requires 200K of
memory. The program was written in FORTRAN 77. The IMSL subroutines are re-
quired. MISER2 was developed in 1986.
