 AESOP- INTERACTIVE DESIGN OF LINEAR QUADRATIC REGULATORS AND KALMAN FIL-
TERS

( NASA Lewis Research Center )

     AESOP was developed to solve a number of problems associated with the
design of controls and state estimators for linear time-invariant systems.
The systems considered are modeled in state-variable form by a set of lin-
ear differential and algebraic equations with constant coefficients. Two
key problems solved by AESOP are the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) de-
sign problem and the steady-state Kalman filter design problem. AESOP is
designed to be used in an interactive manner.

     The user can solve design problems and analyze the solutions in a sin-
gle interactive session. Both numerical and graphical information are
available to the user during the session.

     The AESOP program is structured around a list of predefined functions.
Each function performs a single computation associated with control, esti-
mation, or system response determination. AESOP contains over sixty func-
tions and permits the easy inclusion of user defined functions. The user
accesses these functions either by inputting a list of desired functions
in the order they are to be performed, or by specifying a single function to
be performed. The latter case is used when the choice of function and func-
tion order depends on the results of previous functions. The available AE-
SOP functions are divided into several general areas including: 1) program
control, 2) matrix input and revision, 3) matrix formation, 4) open-loop
system analysis, 5) frequency response, 6) transient response, 7) tran-
sient function zeros, 8) LQR and Kalman filter design, 9) eigenvalues and
eigenvectors, 10) covariances, and 11) user-defined functions. The most
important functions are those that design linear quadratic regulators and
Kalman filters. The user interacts with AESOP when using these functions by
inputting design weighting parameters and by viewing displays of designed
system response. Support functions obtain system transient and frequency
responses, transfer functions, and covariance matrices. AESOP can also
provide the user with open-loop system information including stability,
controllability, and observability.

     The AESOP program is written in FORTRAN IV for interactive execution
and has been implemented on an IBM 3033 computer using TSS 370. As currently
configured, AESOP has a central memory requirement of approximately 2 Megs
of 8 bit bytes. Memory requirements can be reduced by redimensioning arrays
in the AESOP program. Graphical output requires adaptation of the AESOP
plot routines to whatever device is available. The AESOP program was devel-
oped in 1984.
