 ZED- A LINE EDITOR FOR THE DEC VAX

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     The ZED editor for the DEC VAX is a simple, yet powerful line editor for
text, program source code, and non-binary data. Line editors can be supe-
rior to screen editors in some cases, such as executing complex multiple or
conditional commands, or editing via slow modem lines. ZED excels in the
area of text processing by using procedure files. For example, such pro-
cedures can reformat a file of addresses or remove all comment lines from a
FORTRAN program.

     In addition to command files, ZED also features versatile search qual-
ifiers, global changes, conditionals, on-line help, hexadecimal mode,
space compression, looping, logical combinations of search strings, jour-
naling, visible control characters, and automatic detabbing.

     The ZED editor was originally developed at Cambridge University in
London and has been continuously enhanced since 1976. Users of the Cam-
bridge implementation have devised such elaborate ZED procedures as chess
games, calculators, and programs for evaluating Pi. This implementation of
ZED strives to maintain the characteristics of the Cambridge editor.

     A complete ZED manual is included on the tape. ZED is written entirely
in C for either batch or interactive execution on the DEC VAX under VMS 4.X
and requires 80,896 bytes of memory. This program was released in 1988 and
updated in 1989.
