 SOLUTION OF RADIATION AND CONVECTION FIN HEAT TRANSFER PROBLEMS

( GENERAL DYNAMICS CORP. )

     This program was developed to provide for the rapid, steady-state so-
lution of fin-type heat transfer problems. The program accomodates a vari-
ety of fin-type heat conduction applications involving radiative and con-
vective boundary conditions with additionally imposed local heat flux. It
also accomodates lengthwise variation of fin boundary conditions, conduc-
tances, and dimensions. The program is particularly suited for use in para-
metric studies during fin design. It can also be used for a variety of one-
dimensional and two-dimensional heat transfer problems that do not corre-
spond specifically to fin-type applications. A powerful and efficient ana-
lytic tool, this program can achieve an order-of-magnitude reduction in run
time when employed as a substitute for a general purpose heat transfer pro-
gram.

     The heat transfer application addressed by this program is represented
by a second order ordinary differential equation and is posed as a two-point
boundary value problem. An implicit finite difference method is used to
approximate the differential equation. The Newton-Raphson method is em-
ployed with a tri-diagonal linear equation technique to solve the system
of implicit difference equations. The program computes fin node tempera-
tures, while boundary node temperatures are constrained. Vertical link-
ages are used to represent radiation or convection, and could easily be con-
trived to represent conduction. Fin nodes may have additional heat flux,
and are not required to have vertical linkages.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch or interactive execu-
tion and has been implemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with a cen-
tral memory requirement of approximately 45K (octal) of 60 bit words. This
program was developed in 1980.
