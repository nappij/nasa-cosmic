 SOSPAC- SOLAR SPACE POWER ANALYSIS CODE

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     The Solar Space Power Analysis Code, SOSPAC, was developed to examine
the solar thermal and photovoltaic power generation options available for a
satellite or spacecraft in low earth orbit. SOSPAC is a preliminary systems
analysis tool and enables the engineer to compare the areas, weights, and
costs of several candidate electric and thermal power systems. The config-
urations studied include photovoltaic arrays and parabolic dish systems to
produce electricity only, and in various combinations to provide both ther-
mal and electric power.

     SOSPAC has been used for comparison and parametric studies of proposed
power systems for the NASA Space Station. The initial requirements are pro-
jected to be about 40 kW of electrical power, and a similar amount of thermal
power with temperatures above 1000 degrees Centigrade. For objects in low
earth orbit, the aerodynamic drag caused by suitably large photovoltaic ar-
rays is very substantial. Smaller parabolic dishes can provide thermal en-
ergy at a collection efficiency of about 80%, but at increased cost. SOSPAC
allows an analysis of cost and performance factors of five hybrid power
generating systems. Input includes electrical and thermal power require-
ments, sun and shade durations for the satellite, and unit weight and cost
for subsystems and components. Performance equations of the five config-
urations are derived, and the output tabulates total weights of the power
plant assemblies, area of the arrays, efficiencies, and costs.

     SOSPAC is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been imple-
mented on an IBM PC computer operating under DOS with a central memory re-
quirement of approximately 60K of 8 bit bytes. This program was developed
in 1985.
