 PSANAL- COMPOSITE POINT STRESS ANALYSIS

( ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP. )

     This composite material computer program, PSANAL, is a linear lami-
nate analysis program developed to compute the laminate elastic and ther-
mal properties and the allowable load levels for any combination of applied
membrane and bending loads occuring at a point. Basic orthotropic stress-
strain relationships and standard composite laminate theory formulas are
utilized in the PSANAL analysis. Mechanically applied loads may consist of
three stress resultants and three stress couples, which are assumed to be
acting in constant ratio and may be applied in any combination. A constant
temperature is assumed to exist through each laminate thickness. Individ-
ual lamina thermal loads are computed and included in the allowable-load
analysis. No restrictions are placed on either laminate balance or symme-
try. Both unidirectional "unwoven" tape and pseudo-unidirectional/ bidi-
rectional "woven" fabric prepregs can be accommodated by PSANAL.

     Input data to PSANAL includes lamina properties, allowable strengths
and strains, safety factor, laminate description, and applied loads. Fail-
ure criteria consists of the requirement that no lamina matrix failure is
permitted at limit load, while no fiber failure is allowed at ultimate load.
Lamina failure criteria consists of both maximum stress criteria and max-
imum strain criteria. The PSANAL program has the capability to handle as
many as 10 different prepreg materials and 50 plies per laminate. Output
from PSANAL includes laminate elastic properties, laminate thermal prop-
erties, and allowable load levels.

     The PSANAL program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has
been implemented on an IBM 370 computer with a central memory requirement
of approximately 100K of 8 bit bytes. The PSANAL program was developed in
1975.
