 NEWTONP - CUMULATIVE BINOMIAL PROGRAMS

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     The cumulative binomial program, NEWTONP, is one of a set of three pro-
grams which calculate cumulative binomial probability distributions for
arbitrary inputs. The three programs, NEWTONP, CUMBIN (NPO-17555), and
CROSSER (NPO-17557), can be used independently of one another. NEWTONP can
be used by statisticians and users of statistical procedures, test plan-
ners, designers, and numerical analysts. The program has been used for re-
liability/availability calculations.

     NEWTONP calculates the probably p required to yield a given system re-
liability V for a k-out-of-n system. It can also be used to determine the
Clopper-Pearson confidence limits (either one-sided or two-sided) for the
parameter p of a Bernoulli distribution. NEWTONP can determine Bayesian
probability limits for a proportion (if the beta prior has positive integer
parameters). It can determine the percentiles of incomplete beta distri-
butions with positive integer parameters. It can also determine the per-
centiles of F distributions and the midian plotting positions in probabil-
ity plotting. NEWTONP is designed to work well with all integer values 0 <
k <= n. To run the program, the user simply runs the executable version and
inputs the information requested by the program. NEWTONP is not designed to
weed out incorrect inputs, so the user must take care to make sure the inputs
are correct. Once all input has been entered, the program calculates and
lists the result. It also lists the number of iterations of Newton's method
required to calculate the answer within the given error.

     The NEWTONP program is written in C. It was developed on an IBM AT with
a numeric co-processor using Microsoft C 5.0. Because the source code is
written using standard C structures and functions, it should compile cor-
rectly with most C compilers. The program format is interactive. It has
been implemented under DOS 3.2 and has a memory requirement of 26K. NEWTONP
was developed in 1988.
