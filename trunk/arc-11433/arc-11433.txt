 VASCOMP II- V/STOL AIRCRAFT SIZING AND PERFORMANCE

( BOEING VERTOL CO. )

     The VASCOMP2 computer program was developed to aid in the comparative
design study of V/STOL aircraft systems by rapidly providing aircraft size
and mission performance data. VASCOMP2 can be used to define design re-
quirements such as weight breakdown, required propulsive power, and phys-
ical dimensions of aircraft which are to meet specified mission require-
ments. The program is also useful in sensitivity studies involving both de-
sign trade-offs and performance trade-offs. Generality and flexibility
were maintained during formulation of the program in order to permit an ac-
curate simulation of virtually any V/STOL configuration. VASCOMP2 is ca-
pable of approximating the design process involved in the layout and siz-
ing of a wide variety of V/STOL aircraft and synthesizing the performance of
these aircraft. The program is intended for use in the study of V/STOL air-
craft which use fixed wing lift for primary cruise flight. The program is
not suited for the study of aircraft which employ rotary wing lift for for-
ward flight.

     The VASCOMP2 program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and
has been implemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with a central mem-
ory requirement of approximately 112K (octal) of 60 bit words. The VASCOMP2
program was developed in 1968 and last updated in 1980.
