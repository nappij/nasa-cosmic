 ONE-DIMENSIONAL NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF THE TRANSIENT THERMAL RESPONSE OF
MULTILAYER INSULATIVE SYSTEMS

( NASA Langley Research Center )

     This program performs a one-dimensional numerical analysis of the
transient thermal response of multi-layer insulative systems. The analy-
sis can determine the temperature distribution through a system consist-
ing of from one to four layers, one of which can be an air gap. Concentrated
heat sinks at any interface can be included. The computer program based on
the analysis will determine the thickness of a specified layer that will
satisfy a temperature limit criterion at any point in the insulative sys-
tem. The program will also automatically calculate the thickness at sev-
eral points on a system and determine the total system mass. This program
was developed as a tool for designing thermal protection systems for high-
speed aerospace vehicles but could be adapted to many areas of industry in-
volved in thermal insulation systems.

     In this package, the equations describing the transient thermal re-
sponse of a system are developed. The governing differential equation for
each layer and boundary condition are put in finite-difference form using a
Taylor's series expansion. These equations yield an essentially tridiag-
onal matrix of unknown temperatures. A procedure based on Gauss' elimina-
tion method is used to solve the matrix.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV for the CDC RUN compiler and has
been implemented on a CDC 6000 series machine operating under SCOPE 3.0.
This program requires a minimum of 44K (octal) of 60 bit words of memory.
