	        Tape Certification Using the TAPECERT Program

The following contains a description of the TAPECERT tape certification program 
and operator documentation for its use.  A  tape certification program tests 
the usability of magnetic tape at different densities by writing test patterns 
and re-reading them. The ability to certify tapes is important in environments 
that do large amounts of  tape processing.  Many  such  environments  purchase 
special tape certification machines. The advantage of certification machines is
that the tape can be certified off-line. One  problem however, is that they 
cost as much, or more than  a tape-drive but they cannot be used as a 
tape-drive. A tape certification program is then a cost-effective alternative 
to an expensive certification machine.

TAPECERT is used to certify tapes at the Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
Multi-Mission Image Processing Lab (MIPL).  MIPL has a library of 80,000 tapes 
plus a large pool of scratch tapes which are continuously re-used. There are 8
System Industries 1950 tri-density tape drives distributed among 2 DEC VAX 780s 
running VMS 3.7 and 3 DEC TA78/TU77 dual-density tape drives on  a DEC VAX 8600 
running VMS 4.2 at MIPL. MIPL performs image processing activities for projects 
such as: SIR-B, Voyager, VRM and Galileo.

The TAPECERT program functions in the following way: It first writes  64K test 
pattern blocks to the tape - the maximum block-size is used to minimize the 
number of inter-record gaps (approximately 2% of the tape will be inter-
record gap). The tape is then rewound and the test pattern blocks are read back 
and compared. The user may optionally select: the tape density, the 
test-pattern to use, the number of retries to allow before an error becomes 
"hard" and whether to allow "extended inter-record gaps" - VMS will write up to 
16 IRGs to skip past a bad spot on the tape. In the MIPL environment, if the 
"Total err=" count is greater than 0 on any certification run, the tape is 
cleaned and re-certified; then if the error count is still greater than 0 it is 
removed from use. Errors that occur when writing the last record on the tape 
however, can be ignored.

The TAPECERT program has been designed so that command procedures can be set up 
to set defaults for different types of certification runs. Example 1 describes a
procedure that uses no defaults. Examples 2 and 3 describe command procedures 
that are currently being used to certify tapes successfully at MIPL for 1600
and 6250 BPI tapes.


Example 1, TAPECERT:

The following example shows a complete tape certification run using the 
TAPECERT proc. This proc requires the user to specify all options. There are 
no defaults.

The TAPECERT command procedure is invoked and the user is prompted for: the 
tape drive, the name of the tape to be certified, the certification test to 
pattern use, the number of retries to allow before the error becomes a "hard 
error" and whether to allow extended IRGs.

The program displays the options selected before writing the test patterns to 
tape.

	WRITING Test Patterns:
	  Tape drive    =  _MTA0:
	  Retries       =  10
	  Extended IRG  =  N
	  Density  =        6250
	  Pattern  =           1

The program displays error messages and record count information. Current totals
are displayed every 1000 blocks. Here the program is attempting retries to 
write block 231. It took a total of 3 retries to write record 231.
	
	Attempting to write Blk#   231  Retry count =  1
	Attempting to write Blk#   231  Retry count =  2
	Attempting to write Blk#   231  Retry count =  3
	Attempting to write Blk#   617  Retry count =  1
	Attempting to write Blk#   617  Retry count =  2
	Attempting to write Blk#   617  Retry count =  3
	Attempting to write Blk#   617  Retry count =  4
	Attempting to write Blk#   617  Retry count =  5
	Attempting to write Blk#   617  Retry count =  6
	Attempting to write Blk#   617  Retry count =  7
	Attempting to write Blk#   617  Retry count =  8
	Attempting to write Blk#   617  Retry count =  9
	Attempting to write Blk#   617  Retry count = 10



If the number of retries exceeds the number allowed, the VMS error message is 
displayed. Usually this will be a parity error. This is a "hard" error.

An error writing the last record on the tape can be ignored. There may not be 
enough room left on the tape to write it out completely.

After writing the test patterns to tape, they are then read back and checked 
for differences.

	Attempting to read Blk#   617  Retry count =  2

A Fatal Certification read error indicates that there was a definite difference 
between the test pattern and what was read back from the tape. Not all hard-
errors will result in fatal certification read errors.

Example 2, TCSCRATCH:

This example shows the use of the TCSCRATCH  proc. This proc is  used to 
certify a scratch tape for use on the MIPL VAXs. The main use of scratch tapes 
at MIPL is to transfer black-and-white or color images from the VAXs to a 
stand-alone film recorder system that has only a 1600 BPI tape-drive. The 
defaults for this proc are: density=1600, test pattern=7, retries=12 and no 
extended IRGs allowed.

Example 3, TCUSER:

This example shows the use of the TCUSER proc. This proc is used to certify a 
user tape for general use on the MIPL VAXs. The defaults are: density=6250, 
test pattern=5, retries=12 and no extended IRGs allowed.

			     NOTES and HINTS


Clean the tape-drive before certifying tapes.

If you get certification errors on a tape, clean it and then re-certify it.
A MIPL study has shown that two-thirds of tapes with "hard" errors will be 
error free after cleaning.

A tape that is error free at 6250 BPI (GCR) may not necessarily be error free
at 1600 BPI (PE) because of differences in coding formats. Therefore it is 
recommended that a tape be certified at each density that it will be used.

Errors writing the last record on the tape can be safely ignored. There may not 
be enough room on the tape to finish writing the last 64K test pattern.
