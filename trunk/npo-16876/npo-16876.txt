 TAPECERT- A TAPE CERTIFICATION UTILITY FOR DEC VAX/VMS COMPUTERS

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     A tape certification program tests the useability of magnetic tape
at different densities by writing test patterns and re-reading them. The
ability to certify tapes is important in environments that do large amounts
of tape processing. TAPECERT is a VAX utility for tape certification in use
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Multi-Mission Image Processing Laboratory
which handles data from projects such as Voyager and Galileo.

     TAPECERT allows the user to select the tape density, the test pattern
to use, the number of allowed retries, and whether to allow extended inter-
record gaps to skip past bad spots on the tape. The program displays system
error messages (parity errors, for instance) and record count information,
with totals every 1000 blocks. TAPECERT is designed such that command pro-
cedures can be set up with defaults for different types of certification
runs.

     TAPECERT is written in FORTRAN 77 for interactive execution and has
been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer operating under VMS level 3.7
and level 4.2. TAPECERT utilizes standard VMS system services and run-time
library routines. This program was developed in 1985.
