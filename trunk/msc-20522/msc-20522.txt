 COLDARC- DISSOCIATED AIR FLOW EFFECTS DURING PLASMA ARC TESTING

( ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP. )

     The COLDARC program was developed as part of an effort to predict the
heating rate and surface friction effects on the Thermal Protection System
of the Space Shuttle Orbiter during re-entry environments. COLDARC enables
the user to predict the heating rate and surface friction on a test article
during plasma arc testing. This program takes into account the effects of
dissociated air flow over the specimen and the associated heat flux and sur-
face temperatures. Normally, plasma arc testing involves air flow over a
test specimen having a relatively smooth surface. Since the orbiter Ther-
mal Protection System does not constitute a smooth mold line surface, the
COLDARC program was necessary to assess the impact of this surface rough-
ness and the dissociated air flow. COLDARC uses a simplified frozen flow
model to represent the dissociated air flow and to predict the heat flux and
surface friction, including the effects or retarded atomic recombination,
from test facility data.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been
implemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with a central memory re-
quirement of approximately 40K (octal) of 60 bit words. COLDARC was devel-
oped in 1981.
