 LMSS SERVICES FINANCIAL REPORT PROGRAM

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     The objective of this Services Finance Report program is to provide a
means for comparing alternative designs of LMSS systems or other services
systems. This program is actually a Multiplan worksheet. The labels used
in the worksheet were chosen for a satellite-based cellular communication
service (LMSS - Land Mobile Satellite System) but the analysis is not re-
stricted to such cases. A comprehensive financial model is used to calcu-
late a 'figure of merit' which can be used to compare effects of equipment
and operating costs, pricing strategy, and customer demand for different
systems. The program also calculates the price that a company would have
to charge customers to meet all its expenses and make a specified profit. A
price estimate can be obtained for almost any service which is heavily de-
pendent on capital investment and which has operating costs that depend on
the amount of service sold.

     The economic analysis has two main components: supplier finances and
customer finances. Supplier finances include amortization, interest, in-
surance, taxes, and operating and maintenance expenses. Customer finances
include usage rate, subscription fees, equipment costs, and estimated
traffic. Prices can defined as real or nominal to account for effects of es-
calation and inflation, and the profits can be regulated or unrestricted

     This program is written for interactive execution with Multiplan (ver-
sion 1.2) and has been implemented on an IBM PC series computer operating
under DOS (version 2.11). The LMSS worksheet has a space requirement of ap-
proximately 38K of 8 bit bytes. This worksheet was developed in 1984.
