 SOAR- SOFTWARE FOR OPTICAL ARCHIVE AND RETRIEVAL

( SAR INCORPORATED )

     Software for Optical Archive and Retrieval, SOAR, is an interface be-
tween the VAX computer's VMS operating system and a WORM optical disk drive.
The Write-Once-Read-Many optical disk technology (WORM) does not permit
the overwriting of files. SOAR creates a seamless user interface for this
new device, allowing the user to write data files using commands very sim-
ilar to the ones already used in VMS. The optical disk can be read using the
standard VMS commands for file access. SOAR maintains a directory list on
the magnetic drive until the optical disk is filled with data, then perma-
nently writes this directory list to the optical disk.

     The development of SOAR was accomplished by using a hardware interface
that converts the DEC MSCP protocol into the SCSI protocol of the optical
disk. To meet this need, a pseudo-device driver is created in software upon
initialization and used during the write phase. Required hardware includes
a bus adapter and an optical disk drive. The optical disk drives that SOAR
supports are the 1 Gbyte 12-inch drives made by OSI, ATG, and Optimem. Mul-
tiple drives can be configured using a single controller. Examples of hard-
ware configurations are given in the user's manual.

     SOAR is written in VAX MACRO ASSEMBLER (67%), VAX FORTRAN 77 (22%), and
VAX DCL (11%). It was developed to run on a DEC VAX or MicroVAX computer op-
erating under VAX/VMS and has a central memory requirement of 18K. SOAR was
developed in 1987 and updated in 1988.
