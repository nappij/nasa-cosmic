 FPT- FORTRAN PROGRAMMING TOOLS FOR THE DEC VAX

( NASA Ames Research Center )

     The FORTRAN Programming Tools (FPT) are a series of tools used to sup-
port the development and maintenance of FORTRAN 77 source codes. Included
are a debugging aid, a CPU time monitoring program, source code maintenance
aids, print utilities, and a library of useful, well-documented programs.
These tools assist in reducing development time and encouraging high qual-
ity programming. Although intended primarily for FORTRAN programmers,
some of the tools can be used on data files and other programming languages.

     BUGOUT is a series of FPT programs that have proven very useful in de-
bugging a particular kind of error and in optimizing CPU-intensive codes.
The particular type of error is the illegal addressing of data or code as
a result of subtle FORTRAN errors that are not caught by the compiler or at
run time. A TRACE option also allows the programmer to verify the execution
path of a program. The TIME option assists the programmer in identifying
the CPU-intensive routines in a program to aid in optimization studies.

     Program coding, maintenance, and print aids available in FPT include:
routines for building standard format subprogram stubs; cleaning up com-
mon blocks and NAMELISTs; removing all characters after column 72; display-
ing two files side by side on a VT-100 terminal; creating a neat listing of a
FORTRAN source code including a Table of Contents, an Index, and Page Head-
ings; converting files between VMS internal format and standard carriage
control format; changing text strings in a file without using EDT; and re-
placing tab characters with spaces.

     The library of useful, documented programs includes the following:
time and date routines; a string categorization routine; routines for con-
verting between decimal, hex, and octal; routines to delay process ex-
ecution for a specified time; a Gaussian elimination routine for solv-
ing a set of simultaneous linear equations; a curve fitting routine for
least squares fit to polynomial, exponential, and sinusoidal forms (with a
screen-oriented editor); a cubic spline fit routine; a screen-oriented ar-
ray editor; routines to support parsing; and various terminal support rou-
tines.

     These FORTRAN programming tools are written in FORTRAN 77 and ASSEM-
BLER for interactive and batch execution. FPT is intended for implementa-
tion on DEC VAX series computers operating under VMS. This collection of
tools was developed in 1985.
