CCLEAN

ComClean is a program which cleans up COMMON blocks in a FORTRAN source code.
It is especially useful after a program has been "TIDYed". All COMMON blocks
and NAMELISTs are cleaned up in the following manner:
     1. The name of the COMMON block or NAMELIST is padded with blanks to make
it six characters long.
     2. The variable names are aligned in columns 8 characters wide. If a sub-
script results in a name of more than 8 characters, the next name will be moved
to the next column.
     3. If this expansion results in more than 19 continuation cards, the
comment 'C$$$$$$' is placed after the last continuation card.

To execute the program enter :

         CCLEAN filespec

where 'filespec' does not include the '.FOR' suffix. A new version of 
'filespec'.FOR will be created. If the program ends abnormally for any
reason, there will be a file named 'TEMP.CLN' on your directory.
