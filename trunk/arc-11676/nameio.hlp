1 NAMEIO

The NAMEIO and SNAMEIO packages provide a transportable sideset of the non- 
standard FORTRAN feature, NAMELIST.  Both packages provide name-oriented 
reading and writing of variables and arrays.  The NAMEIO package generates 
code that uses COMMON block names to categorize IO.  The SNAMEIO package 
can be used without knowledge of what COMMONs contain the variables.
