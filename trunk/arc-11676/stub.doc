STUB

STUB is a program for automatically creating prologues for FORTRAN programs.
The program will create just prologues or entire program stubs complete with
duplicate code in every subprogram. To execute enter:

         STUB filespec

where 'filespec' is the name of the FORTRAN source code to be created(less the
.FOR suffix). Prologues can be created after a source code exists, the pro-
loguse would then be merged using the EDT 'INCLUDE' command.

For more information see Art Ragosta.
