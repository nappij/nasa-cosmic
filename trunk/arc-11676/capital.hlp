1 CAPITAL

CAPITALize is a program to convert files with lower case letters to the same
file with only capital letters.  All symbols other than lower case letters are
echoed without modification.

Enter :

CAPITAL filespec

where 'filespec' is the name of the input file.  A new version of 'filespec'
will be created.  If the program ends abnormally for any reason, a file named
TEMP.CAP will exist on your directory with the partially converted file.
