LONGLIB graphics library installation notes

***********************************************************************

The entire library source is contained in one directory.

Use LONGLIB.COM to create the longlib.olb graphics library and its associated
libraries.  You may wish to edit this command file to create only the
desired libraries.  Three similar object libraries are created:

	1. LONGLIB.OLB (includes Ramtek communication routines)
	2. LONGLIB2.OLB (does not include any Ramtek routines)
	3. LONGLIBR.OLB (includes Ramtek emulation routines)

A help library LONGLIB.HLB is also created as well as the documentation
file LONGLIB.DOC.  This command file also compiles some of the most used
auxilary programs.

The library supports a large number of graphics terminals.
It should be possible to adapt this code to other terminal graphics
devices.

A backup tape has been created from VMS version 4.0.
To install the package from tape create a directory [LONGLIB] then:

	$ allocate mta0: tape:		! mta0: is the input tape device
	$ mount/foreign tape
	$ backup tape:*.*/save [longlib]
	$ dismount tape
	$ deallocate tape

After copying the LONGLIB files from tape to disk, assign the logical name
LONGLOC to the directory location of the longlib routines. This logical
name should be assigned as a system name.  It is used by various routines
and command files in the library.

	$ assign/system disk_name:[longlib] LONGLOC:

Create the libraries by executing the command file LONGLIB.COM. (see
note below)  All told, the LONGLIB graphics package occupies the better
part of 10k blocks (additional space is needed while creating the libraries).

	$ set def [longlib]
	$ @LONGLIB.COM

The LONGLIB2 library contains dummy routines for the Ramtek routines.
If you desire only the non-Ramtek portion of library then
after executing LONGLIB.COM, delete LONGLIB.OLB and rename LONGLIB2.OLB
to be LONGLIB.OLB.  A second option is to use LONG2.COM which will create
a library named LONGLIB.OLB which does not contain the ramtek routines
(i.e. is equivalent to LONGLIB2.OLB).  Normally, LONGLIBR (the REF routine
subpackage) should be kept.

LONGLIB.COM also compiles and links various executable programs such
as REPLOT (for plotting a printer file to a screen device) and the
metafile converstion program.  It also creates the LONGLIB.HLP on-line
help library.



Documentation is in LONGLIB.DOC.  Source text for the documentation is in
LONGLIB.RNO.  Use DOC.COM to generate a printable copy.  DOC.COM will
need to edited to identify the directory location of the library if not
contained in LONGLOC:.  Use the programs SYMBOLS.FOR, LINETYPE.FOR,
PLOTTESTS.FOR, etc. to create the appendix to the documentation.

For VAX VMS Version 3.x use DOCV3.COM to create the printable documentation.

Help library source text is in LONGLIB.HLP.  A user library pointer
should be defined to access this help library.

	$define/system hlp$library_1 LONGLOC:LONGLIB

A program called PLOTTESTS may be used to verify the library.  It is not
an extensive test but is a good check of the plot package.  See
also CURTEST and the other example programs.

It will be convenient to globally define "longlib" to contain the
disk device and directory name.  Thus linking to the longlib can
be accomplished easily.  The system help library definitions should
also include the longlib help library.

	$ define/system LONGLIB disk_name:[longlib]LONGLIB
	$ define/system LONGLIB disk_name:[longlib]LONGLIBR

	$ link file_name,LONGLIB/lib

A compile/link/run command file is available in PLOAD.COM.

The system operator may also wish to make commonly used commands
available as system commands.



Shareable Image Library 

A shareable image library has been added to the package.
To create the shareable image library, execute LONGSHR.COM after
establishing the regular library system and system names.  Then execute
the LONGSHR.COM command file.

	$ @LONGSHR.COM

To make the most of the shareable image file the image file must
be installed (requiring system privledges) using the following set
of commands after the system names have been set up:

	$ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:INSTALL
	LONGLOC:LONGLIB.EXE /OPEN /SHARE

Other graphics devices

Hardcopy graphics devices can be accomodated by creating a version of
metafile processing programs such as REPLOT, LASER, TRILGLO, etc.
Note that metafile processing programs use OPEN statements for opening
files, etc.  These can be commented out to permit out-of-program assign
statements to be used.  This is useful for specification of scratch
area files.



Machine Dependent Notes:

This software was developed on a VAX 780 using the VMS operating
systems and the VAX FORTRAN.  Every attempt has been made to make
the code FORTRAN-77 compatible but there are exceptions (see source
code and documentation.

It should be possible to adapt this software to other VAX operating
systems and/or machines.  For use on other than VAX machines consider
see the following notes:

 Note: source code uses "BYTE" and "INTEGER*2" data types in some
 areas (notably the Ramtek stuff).  Handling the string variables
 uses the VAX FORTRAN BYTE (see documentation).
 Some other machine dependent structures (such as %loc and %ref) are
 also used (see documentation and source code)

 Note: additional plotting devices can be added to library by modifying
 the device dependent subroutines in section one of the source code file
 LONGLIB.FOR.  Examples of both linked list vector plotting (where a starting
 point, a set of intermediate points, and an end point are
 given -- used by the ramtek and vt100) or single vector
 (where only one line segment -- start point, end point -- are plotted at
 a time -- used for the meta file) subroutines are in source code.
