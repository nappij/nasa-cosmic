 LONGLIB - A GRAPHICS LIBRARY

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     This library is a set of subroutines designed for vector plotting to
CRT's, plotters, dot matrix, and laser printers. LONGLIB subroutines are
invoked by program calls similar to standard CALCOMP routines. In addition
to the basic plotting routines, LONGLIB contains an extensive set of rou-
tines to allow viewport clipping, extended character sets, graphic input,
shading, polar plots, and 3-D plotting with or without hidden line removal.

     LONGLIB capabilities include surface plots, contours, histograms,
logarithm axes, world maps, and seismic plots. LONGLIB includes master
subroutines, which are self-contained series of commonly used individual
subroutines. When invoked, the master routine will initialize the plot-
ting package, and will plot multiple curves, scatter plots, log plots, 3-D
plots, etc. and then close the plot package, all with a single call.

     Supported devices include VT100 equipped with Selanar GR100 or GR100+
boards, VT125s, VT240s, VT220 equipped with Selanar SG220, Tektronix
4010/4014 or 4107/4109 and compatibles, and Graphon GO-235 terminals. Dot
matrix printer output is available by using the provided raster scan con-
version routines for DEC LA50, Printronix printers, and high or low res-
olution Trilog printers. Other output devices include QMS laser print-
ers, Postscript compatible laser printers, and HPGL compatible plotters.
The LONGLIB package includes the graphics library source code, an on-line
help library, scan converter and meta file conversion programs, and command
files for installing, creating, and testing the library.

     The latest version, 5.0, is significantly enhanced and has been made
more portable. Also, the new version's meta file format has been changed
and is incompatible with previous versions. A conversion utility is in-
cluded to port the old meta files to the new format. Color terminal plotting
has been incorporated.

     LONGLIB is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch or interactive execution and
has been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer operating under VMS. This
program was developed in 1985, and last updated in 1988.
