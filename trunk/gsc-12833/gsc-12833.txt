 NASTRAN NASTPLT PLOTTING POST PROCESSOR

( COMPUTER SCIENCES CORP. )

     The NASTRAN NASTPLT Plotting Post Processor was developed to read NAS-
TRAN generated NASTPLT plot files, to check the file contents for validity,
and to translate the NASTPLT plot commands into appropriate calls to plot-
ting routines for either CalComp, Tektronix PLOT10, or Versatec plotting
systems. This program was originally written to generate a summary of the
contents of a NASTPLT plot file for the purposes of debugging and checking
the validity and characteristics of the file contents. The summary infor-
mation generated includes the following information for each plot on the
NASTPLT file: plot number, draw-lines summary, draw-axis summary, draw-
character summary, maximum and minimum values in the x-range and y-range,
and pen change information. The summary information also includes the fol-
lowing information for the NASTPLT file as a whole: the number of records
read, the number of commands, and the number of plots.

     The summary generation program was extended to include the plot rou-
tine calls for the CalComp, Tektronix PLOT10, and Versatec plotting sys-
tems. The Post Processor is run interactively and prompts the user for all
of the required input. The user may request the summary information and
then use that information to determine which plots on the file are to be out-
put. The Post Processor is compatible with either VAX or IBM NASTRAN gener-
ated NASTPLT files.

     The Post Processor is written in FORTRAN IV PLUS for interactive execu-
tion and has been implemented on a DEC VAX-11/780 computer under VMS. This
program was developed in 1981.
