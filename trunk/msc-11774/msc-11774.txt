 AXISYMMETRIC TWO-PHASE PERFECT GAS PERFORMANCE

( TRW Systems Group )

     This program calculates the inviscid axisymmetric nozzle expansion of
propellant systems having both gaseous and condensed exhaust products.

     The program considers the velocity and thermal lags (for ten particle
groups) between the gaseous and condensed combustion products (when they
are present in the chamber). It does not consider mass transfer (only mo-
mentum and energy transfer) between gaseous and condensed combustion prod-
ucts. It also does not consider nonequilibrium effects of finite rate chem-
ical reactions between gaseous and combustion products. This program con-
siders only the expansion of a uniform mixture (the ideal engine case).

     Standard explicit integration methods are utilized. The program is de-
signed for engineering use and is specified and programmed in a straight-
forward manner to facilitate its use as a development tool.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV and has been implemented on an IBM
7094. This program was developed in 1967.
