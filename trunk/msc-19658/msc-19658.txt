 HIGH PRESSURE GAS STORAGE SYSTEM BLOWDOWN AND CHARGING MODELS

( ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP. )

     This program is a simulation model for predicting the pressure and tem-
perature histories occurring in recharge or blowdown processes for high
pressure gas storage systems. The model allows for real gas effects as well
as conductive, convective, and radiative heat transfer to the storage con-
tainer walls for any environmental boundary conditions. The parameter val-
ues currently encoded into the program code are those appropriate for siz-
ing the fuel cell high pressure hydrogen and oxygen reactant gas storage
subsystem for the Shuttle Orbiter 101 approach and landing test program.
However the model can be applied with some modification to sizing and per-
formance prediction of industrial high pressure gas storage systems sub-
ject to time varying thermal environmental conditions.

     The program as written utilizes the IBM Fortran G compiler and IBM Con-
tinuous System Modeling Application Program (CSMP), Level 3 and has been
successully implemented on an IBM 370/168 under OS Release 21.6 in a 180K of
central memory.
