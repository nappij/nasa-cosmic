 A GENERAL ALGORITHM FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CONTOUR PLOTS

( NASA Ames Research Center )

     The graphical presentation of experimentally or theoretically gen-
erated data sets frequently involves the construction of contour plots. A
general computer algorithm has been developed for the construction of con-
tour plots. The algorithm provides for efficient and accurate contouring
with a modular approach which allows flexibility in modifying the algorithm
for special applications. The algorithm accepts as input data values at a
set of points irregularly distributed over a plane. The algorithm is based
on an interpolation scheme in which the points in the plane are connected by
straight line segments to form a set of triangles. In general, the data is
smoothed using a least-squares-error fit of the data to a bivariate polyno-
mial. To construct the contours, interpolation along the edges of the tri-
angles is performed, using the bivariable polynomial if data smoothing was
performed. Once the contour points have been located, the contour may be
drawn.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been
implemented on an IBM 360 series computer with a central memory requirement
of approximately 100K of 8-bit bytes. This computer algorithm was devel-
oped in 1981.
