 NEQHTCAT- LAMINAR NONEQUILIBRIUM AEROHEATING

( ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP. )

     The Laminar Nonequilibrium Heating program (NEQHTCAT) is used to pre-
dict the nonequilibrium heating on the surface of a partially catalytic
flat plate moving at supersonic speed through the atmosphere. NEQHTCAT has
been used to analyze the aeroheating effects on the Shuttle Orbiter for var-
ious re-entry trajectories.

     Typical programs for calculating complicated aeroheating phenomena
require many input variables, but NEQHTCAT requires only five: 1) total
enthalpy, 2) local pressure, 3) plate length, 4) wall temperature, and 5)
local velocity (derived from actual flight data). The program calculates
thermodynamic properties and equilibrium edge properties and converts
these, where required, to a frozen boundary layer condition.

     NEQHTCAT is written in FORTRAN V for batch execution and has been im-
plemented on an IBM 370 series computer operating under OS with a central
memory requirement of approximately 82K of 8 bit bytes. This program was
developed in 1984.
