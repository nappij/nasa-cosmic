 VELOCITIES AND STREAMLINES ON A BLADE-TO-BLADE STREAM SURFACE OF A TANDEM
BLADE TURBOMACHINE

( NASA Lewis Research Center )

     This computer program gives the blade-to-blade solution of the two-
dimensional, subsonic, compressible (or incompressible), nonviscous flow
problem for a circular or straight infinite cascade of tandem or slotted
turbomachine blades. The blades may be fixed or rotating. The flow may be
axial, radial , or mixed.

     The method of solution is based on the stream function using an itera-
tive solution of nonlinear finite-difference equations. These equations
are solved using two major levels of iteration. The inner iteration con-
sists of the solution of simultaneous linear equations by successive over-
relaxation, using an estimated optimum over-relaxation factor. The outer
iteration then changes the coefficients of the simultaneous equations to
correct for compressibility.

     The program input consists of the basic blade geometry, the merid-
ional stream channel coordinates, fluid stagnation conditions, weight flow
and flow split through the slot, and inlet and outlet flow angles. The out-
put includes blade surface velocities, velocity magnitude and direction
throughout the passage, and the streamline coordinates.
