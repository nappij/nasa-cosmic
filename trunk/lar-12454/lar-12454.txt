 MASPROP- MASS PROPERTIES OF A RIGID STRUCTURE

( NASA Langley Research Center )

     The computer program MASPROP was developed to rapidly calculate the
mass properties of complex rigid structural systems. This program's ba-
sic premise is that complex systems can be adequately described by a com-
bination of basic elementary structural shapes. Thirteen widely used ba-
sic structural shapes are available in this program. They are as follows:
Discrete Mass, Cylinder, Truncated Cone, Torus, Beam (arbitrary cross sec-
tion), Circular Rod (arbitrary cross section), Spherical Segment, Sphere,
Hemisphere, Parallelepiped, Swept Trapezoidal Panel, Symmetric Trape-
zoidal Panels, and a Curved Rectangular Panel. MASPROP provides a designer
with a simple technique that requires minimal input to calculate the mass
properties of a complex rigid structure and should be useful in any situa-
tion where one needs to calculate the center of gravity and moments of iner-
tia of a complex structure.

     Rigid body analysis is used to calculate mass properties. Mass proper-
ties are calculated about component axes that have been rotated to be paral-
lel to the system coordinate axes. Then the system center of gravity is cal-
culated and the mass properties are transferred to axes through the system
center of gravity by using the parallel axis theorem. System weight, mo-
ments of inertia about the system origin, and the products of inertia about
the system center of mass are calculated and printed. From the information
about the system center of mass the principal axes of the system and the mo-
ments of inertia about them are calculated and printed.

     The only input required is simple geometric data describing the size
and location of each element and the respective material density or weight
of each element.

     This program is written in FORTRAN for execution on a CDC 6000 series
computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 62K (octal) of
60 bit words. The development of this program was completed in 1978.
