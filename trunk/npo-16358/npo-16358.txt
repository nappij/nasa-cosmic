 LOOK- A TEXT FILE DISPLAY PROGRAM

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     The LOOK program was developed to permit a user to examine a text file
in a psuedo-random access manner. Many engineering and scientific pro-
grams generate large amounts of printed output. Often this output needs
to be examined in only a few places. On mini-computers (like the DEC VAX)
high-speed printers are usually at a premium. One alternative is to save
the output in a text file and examine it with a text editor. The slowness of
a text editor, the possibility of inadvertently changing the output, and
other factors make this an unsatisfactory solution. The LOOK program pro-
vides the user with a means of rapidly examining the contents of an ASCII
text file.

     LOOK's basis of operation is to open the text file for input only and
then access it in a block-wise fashion. LOOK handles the text formatting
and displays the text lines on the screen. The user can move forward or
backward in the file by a given number of lines or blocks. LOOK also pro-
vides the ability to "scroll" the text at various speeds in the forward or
backward directions. The user can perform a search for a string (or a com-
bination of up to 10 strings) in a forward or backward direction. Also, user
selected portions of text may be extracted and submitted to print or placed
in a file. Additional features available to the LOOK user include: cancel-
lation of an operation with a keystroke, user definable keys, switching
mode of operation (e.g. 80/132 column), on-line help facility, trapping
broadcast messages, and the ability to spawn a sub-process to carry out DCL
functions without leaving LOOK.

     The LOOK program is written in FORTRAN 77 and MACRO ASSEMBLER for in-
teractive execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX computer using
VAX/VMS with a central memory requirement of approximately 430K of 8 bit
bytes. LOOK operation is terminal independent but will take advantage of
the features of the DEC VT100 terminal if available. LOOK was developed in
1983.
