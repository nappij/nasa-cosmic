 DIGITAL FILTER DESIGN

( McDonnell Douglas Corp. )

     The Digital Filter Design program presents a method to compare desired
and designed digital filters by minimizing the sum-square-error of the dif-
ferences in magnitude and phase angles. Most filter design techniques em-
phasize magnitude characteristics. Such techniques are adequate for con-
trol systems where the phase angle of a filter imposes minor effects on sys-
tem stability. However, for closed loop feedback control systems, an ex-
cessive phase angle of a designed filter may create signal distortion or
push the system to instability. This Digital Filter Design program has been
applied to the Space Shuttle pitch body bending filter, where the filter was
reshaped to provide more attenuation to flexible vehicle resonance modes
without sacrificing the rigid vehicle performance.

     This program uses the Fletcher-Powell unconstrained minimization
method to calculate a performance index from the magnitude and phase er-
rors. This index can then be used to measure the goodness of various fil-
ter designs. Input includes the number of second order cascade sections in
the designed filter, available frequency data points with desired phase and
magnitude, weighting factors for phase and magnitude, initial estimates of
filter coefficients and gain, and system sampling time. Subroutines are
provided for printing and simple plotting of the frequency response of the
designed filter.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been
implemented on a CDC Cyber 830 computer operating under NOS with a central
memory requirement of approximately 76K (octal) of 60 bit words. This pro-
gram was developed in 1983.
