*  INTRODUCTION  *
******************



The TOSS library of mission analysis programs is concerned, in part, 
with the problem of determining when targets are available for
observation.  A data file has been defined that specifies the
requirements that must be considered in determining availability.



Note the distinction between the visibility of a target and its
availability for observation.  A target is visible if it is not occulted
by the earth, sun, moon, planet, or spacecraft hardware.  A target is
available if it is visible and satisfies other specific reqirements
(for example, whether the spacecraft is in orbit day or night). 


The following requirements are used by TOSS programs to determine the
availability of a target for observation: 

      - target to be observed

      - orbit day/night status of the spacecraft

      - TDRS visibility

      - South Atlantic Anomaly passage

      - minimum angle between the sun and target

      - minimum angle between the moon and target

      - minimum angle between the bright earth limb and celestial target

      - minimum angle between the dark earth limb and celestial target

      - minimum angle between the velocity vector and the target

      - max angle between the zenith direction and the target

      - occultation of target by the spacecraft body




TOSS has a reader, RDREQMT, that reads this file.  The remainder of
this document assumes that RDREQMT will be used.


Even if the requirements file conforms to this document, your program
must use the data correctly.  This file just tells your program what is
required.  For instance, if you require orbit night for observations,
your program must check the orbit night requirement flag and, if
necessary, determine when orbit night occurs. 


TOSS will contain a constraints package, <TBD>, that reads and stores
the requirements internally and returns availability info for a given
time. Using this package frees you from coding the tests yourself. 



************
*  FORMAT  *
************


The file format is given below.  The file can be created and manipulated
by a text editor.  RDREQMT reads the file in a list-directed manner. 


The file consists of one or more groups of records, each group being
associated with a single experiment.  Within each group, the following
holds: 

    record 1 is a comment line(possibly blank);

    record 2 identifies the experiment by name;

    the next several records form a subgroup of records that define
    requirements associated with the experiment; these requirements
    are true for all targets of that experiment;

    the next record identifies a target;

    the next record identifies another target;

                        :
                        :
                        :

    the last record has its first value as -9999; no other use is made
    of this record;

RECORD 1 FOR EACH EXPERIMENT
----------------------------

   Record 1 is a comment line, so its contents may be anything
   convenient.  Except for listing it with the rest of the file,
   RDREQMT reads and ignores this record.

   This record is directly behind the -9999 record of the preceeding
   experiment's data, if one is present.




RECORD 2 FOR EACH EXPERIMENT
----------------------------

   Record 2 identifies the experiment by name.


     Parameter 1. (character)  Experiment name

       1 to 8 characters;

       the name must be non-blank and enclosed in single quotes;

   Example:  'NAME1'/



   
RECORDS 3ff. EXPERIMENT-DEPENDENT REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------------

  Several requirements can be specified here, one per record.  Each
  requirement has a keyword by which the reader knows what kind of
  requirement is being specified.  Each record consists of a keyword
  and one or two parameter values associated with that keyword.  If a
  keyword is permitted but not present in the file, the reader routine,
  RDREQMT, will assign a value which, when applied to that requirement,
  gives the same target availability as though the requirement did not
  exist.  The keywords may appear in any order(except 'ENDREQ').

  In general, this set of records look like:

       'keyworda', valuea1, valuea2 /
       'keywordb', valueb1, valueb2 /
       'keywordc', valuec1, valuec2 /
       'ENDREQ'/

        example of one record:   'ZENITH', 45./

  TDRS             TDRS requirement

              1    flag identifying the TDRS's that must be visible
                   during an observation

  DAYNIGHT         orbit night requirement

              1    =0, ignore day/night status
                   =1, observations occur only during orbit night
                   =2, observations occur only during orbit day
                   =otherwise, error condition in RDREQMT

                   PROGRAM AND THIS KEYWORD IS NOT ON THE FILE


  SAA              South Atlantic Anomaly requirement flag and models

              1    if positive, observations occur only outside of the
                   SAA and this is the model number

                   PROGRAM AND THIS KEYWORD IS NOT ON THE FILE

              2    if positive, observations occur only outside of the
                   SAA and this is a second model number

                   DEFAULT = 0.D0 WHEN REQ'MT IS PERMITTED BY THE
                   PROGRAM AND THIS KEYWORD IS NOT ON THE FILE

                   note: if both are zero or negative, then SAA is
                         ignored; if both are positive, observations
                         occur when s/c is within neither SAA region;
                         if only one is positive, s/c must be outside
                         that region


  BODYBLOCK        body blockage flag and blockage mask number

              1    if positive, body blockage is to be considered and
                   this is the mask number; if zero or negative,
                   blockage is to be ignored

  SUNAVOID         sun avoidance requirement

              1    the minimum angle between the line of sight to the
                   target and the line of sight to the sun center(ie,
                   the sun avoidance angle); in degrees;

                   if the separation is less than this angle, target
                   is not available for observation;

                   if the separation is equal to or greater than this
                   angle, availability is not precluded by this
                   requirement, but not assured either;

                   using a zero value is equivalent to having no
                   requirement present;

                   DEFAULT = 0.D0 WHEN REQ'MT IS PERMITTED BY THE

                   the moon avoidance angle); in degrees

                   description is similar to that for the sun avoidance
                   angle in keyword 'SUNAVOID'

  BRIGHTERT        bright earth requirement

              1    the minimum angle between the line of sight to a
                   celestial target and the line of sight to the nearest
                   point on the bright horizon(ie, the avoidance angle
                   for the sunlit horizon); in degrees

                   if the whole horizon is in shadow, the requirement
                   is ignored by <TBD>;

  VELAVOID         velocity vector avoidance requirement

              1    the minimum angle between the velocity vector and the
                   line of sight to the target; in degrees

                   description is similar to that for the sun avoidance

  ENDREQ           signals the end of keyword input for this experiment;
                   it must be present, even if it is the only keyword
                   in the subgroup;

RECORDS 4ff. TARGET-DEPENDENT REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------

Several targets may be defined here, one target per record.  The
reader, RDREQMT, expects the first parameter to be the target ID.

If your program needs more than just the ID, see the reader routine
for more info(see description for the variable REQTGT).

This set of records is in the form:

      id1/
      id2/
      id3/
      -9999/

     example of one record:  420/   (equivalent: 420.D0/)

ID = -9999 ends the set of target records. It must be present, even if
there is only one experiment on the file or there are no other target
records present. 

Zero and negative(except -9999) ID's are ignored by the reader.
