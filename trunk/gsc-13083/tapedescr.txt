SECTION 1.  INTRODUCTION
------------------------

The tape is a standard 9-track, half-inch, magnetic tape recorded
at 1600 BPI.  It was created on a VAX-11/785 using version 4.2 of
VAX/VMS.


The tape was created by the command procedure MAKETAPE.COM listed
in section 3.  The tape was read back for testing using the command
procedure DUMPTAPE.COM listed in section 4.


The program tape has several file types.  The file name suffix
describes the kind of file involved: 

  TXT - text files that comprise the program's documentation;
        all can be read by a text editor

  COM - DCL command files for compiling, linking, and
        executing the program;  all can be read by a text
        editor
                  
  FOR - FORTRAN source code(all code is FORTRAN);  all can
        be read by a text editor;  there are 187 such files;

  INC - FORTRAN 'include' files referenced by one or more
        source files during compilation;  all can be read
        by a text editor;  there are 3 such files;

  EXE - an executable image;  this file cannot be read by a
        text editor

  Uxx - data files used as input to the program or output
        by the program;  Uxx values on the tape are U05, U06,
        U08, U19, U25, U26, U27, and U30;  the user guide
        describes the files;  all can be read by a text
        editor



SECTION 2.  MORE DETAILS ON EACH FILE TYPE
------------------------------------------


  TXT - COSMIC1.TXT is the Submittal Package Document described
           on pages 1 to 3 of the COSMIC Software Submittal Guidelines
           document.

        TAPEDESCR.TXT is this document.

        QUIKVIS.TXT is the program user guide.

        FMT2526.TXT describes the format for output units 25 and 26.

        OBSREQMT.TXT describes the file format for input unit 30.  The
           format given in QUIKVIS.TXT is sufficient for QUIKVIS use but
           the reader routines(those whose names begin with RDREQMT) are
           coded for a wider range of inputs than QUIKVIS permits.
           Full documentation has been included for completeness.

        TARGCATLG.TXT describes the file format for input unit 30.  The
           format given in QUIKVIS.TXT is sufficient for QUIKVIS use but
           the reader routines(those whose names begin with RDCAT) are
           coded for a wider range of inputs than QUIKVIS permits.
           Full documentation has been included for completeness.

        SWCHANGES.TXT contains a brief description of the changes that
           have occurred in QUIKVIS since the original COSMIC submittal
           in the summer of 1986.


  COM - MAKEOBJ.COM compiles all source routines and produces an
           object library

        QVLINK.COM links the program using the object library
           created by MAKEOBJ.COM

        EXAMPLE1.COM executes the first of the two sample runs

        EXAMPLE2.COM executes the second of the two sample runs

        BIGTEST.COM executes MAKEOBJ.COM, QVLINK.COM, EXAMPLE1.COM
           and EXAMPLE2.COM in one run

                  
  FOR - these are FORTRAN source code files

  INC - these are FORTRAN 'include' files referenced by the compiler
           when certain routines are compiled

  EXE - this is the executable image used to create the two sample
           runs supplied with the tape

  Uxx - these are input and output data files associated with the
           two sample runs supplied with the tape
