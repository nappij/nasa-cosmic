PROBLEM/FUNCTION DEFINITION
---------------------------


Instruments on some earth orbiting satellites observe
celestial bodies such as the sun, planets, comets, and
stars.  Typical questions are: 

  - how long may specific celestial objects be observed
    during each satellite revolution about the earth ?

  - if one covered the sky with a grid, how long could
    individual grid points be observed during each satellite
    revolution about the earth ?


The first is asked by one who wants to know the effects of
launch times and dates, the second by one who wants to select
objects to observe.  The QUIKVIS program answers both
questions. 


During an observaton, certain requirements must be satisfied.
Requirements that QUIKVIS can consider are:

  - the line of sight to the object must not be blocked
    by the earth;

  - the angle between the earth horizon and the line of
    sight to the target must exceed a specified minimum
    value;

  - the angle between the velocity vector and the line of
    sight to the target must exceed a specified minimum
    value

  - the angle between the zenith direction and the line of
    sight to the target must be within a specified maximum
    value

  - the satellite must be in the earth's shadow during the
    observation.


Primary output is the time per orbit that the requirements
are satisfied.  The same information is stored on a file
in a format suitable for use by an XY plotter program. 

Secondary output shows the effects of individual
requirements.  The QUIKVIS user guide contains examples of
the output.
 


METHOD OF SOLUTION
------------------


The program handles a multitude of dates and orbit right
ascensions of the ascending node(RAANs).  Only one semimajor
axis and one inclination are used.  The orbit is assumed
circular, but the coding allows easy modification for
eccentric orbits. 


The program analyzes one circuit about the earth for each
date and RAAN combination.  Within the circuit, individual
requirements are applied to find the true anomaly ranges
within which they are satisfied.  The ranges are overlayed
to get a common range from which is derived the duration of
the potential observation time for that circuit.  When all
combinations have been analyzed, the collected results are
presented in a convenient form. 


Specific information on the basic algorithms is:

  - orbit motion is Keplerian

  - the algorithm for computing earth shadow is similar to
    the one described in the book 'Methods of Orbit
    Determination' by P. R. Escobal, 1976 reprint, pages
    155-159;  the subroutine is an old one and original
    documentation on it is not available

  - the algorithm used for the minumum angle to the earth
    horizon is described in the memorandum dated
    October 23, 1985 from H. Swartwood to Mission Analysis
    Section Files titled Star Occultation Analysis; the
    memorandum is enclosure 1

  - the algorithm used for the minumum angle to the velocity
    vector is described in the memorandum dated
    October 24, 1985 from H. Swartwood to Mission Analysis
    Section Files titled Ram Vector Analysis; the memorandum
    is enclosure 2

  - the algorithm used for the maximum angle to the zenith
    direction is described in the memorandum dated
    November 7, 1985 from H. Swartwood to Mission Analysis
    Section Files titled Zenith Vector Analysis; the
    memorandum is enclosure 3

  - analytical expressions are used for the sun and planet
    ephemerides and the rotation matrices relating the Mean
    Equator and Equinox of 1950.0 and Mean Equator and
    Equinox of Date coordinate systems;  the equations are
    from the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical
    Ephereris and the American Ephemeris and Nautical
    Almanac, 1974 reprint of the 1961 edition

  - a spherical earth is assumed

  - atmospheric refraction effects are ignored



USER INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------


The user guide is contained on the submittal tape.  The file
name is QUIKVIS.TXT.  It has about 60 pages.


The user guide refers to document files TARGCATLG.TXT and
OBSREQMT.TXT, both of which are on the submittal tape.  They
have been included for completeness, but the user guide is
sufficient. 



INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING AND TESTING
---------------------------------------


The program was developed on VAX-11/780 and VAX-11/785
computers;  it has not been tried on any others.


The program tape contains several types of files.  The file
name suffix describes the kind of file involved: 

  TXT - text files that comprise the program's documentation;
        all can be read by a text editor

  COM - DCL command files for compiling, linking, and
        executing the program;  all can be read by a text
        editor
                  
  FOR - FORTRAN source code(all code is FORTRAN);  all can
        be read by a text editor;  there are 187 such files;

  INC - FORTRAN 'include' files referenced by one or more
        source files during compilation;  all can be read
        by a text editor;  there are 3 such files;

  EXE - an executable image;  this file cannot be read by a
        text editor

  Uxx - data files used as input to the program or output
        by the program;  Uxx values on the tape are U05, U06,
        U08, U19, U25, U26, U27, and U30;  the user guide
        describes the files;  all can be read by a text
        editor






               ( CONTINUED ON THE NEXT PAGE )



         ( INSTALLING AND TESTING,  CONTINUATION )


The following can be done to install and test the program on 
a VAX:


   1. create a new subdirectory and set the current default
      to that subdirectory;  all tape files will be written
      into that subdirectory;

      comment: the subdirectory has no files yet


   2. create a command file to copy all tape files to disk; 
      name the file TODISK.COM to assure uniqueness;  the
      following DCL may be used:

      $!         FILE NAME = TODISK.COM
      $! 
      $ SET DEFAULT [subdirectory name from step 1 goes here]
      $!
      $ DRIVE = "MTA0:"
      $ ALLOCATE 'DRIVE:'  TAPE
      $ MOUNT    'DRIVE'   QVTAPE  TAPE    ! tape label is QVTAPE
      $!
      $ COPY/LOG  'DRIVE'*.*   *
      $!
      $ DISMOUNT/UNLOAD 'DRIVE'
      $ DEALLOC 'DRIVE'


   3. execute TODISK.COM to copy the tape files to disk;

      after all tape files have been copied to the default
      subdirectory, you will be finished with the tape


   4. using a text editor, modify each command file(.COM);
      change the "DIREC =" statement so that the DIREC value
      is the subdirectory name from step 1;

      the default subdirectory is set in each command file
      to make batch submittal easy in case your subdirectory
      is not the top directory

         ( INSTALLING AND TESTING,  CONTINUATION )



   5.  The following tests should be done:



       5a. recreate the tape's sample output using the input
           data files and executable image that were read
           from the tape in step 4 of the installation
           instructions;  to do this, execute command files
           EXAMPLE1.COM and EXAMPLE2.COM;  batch submittal is
           recommended;  batch submittal can be done by
           entering

                   $ SUBMIT EXAMPLE1  and
                   $ SUBMIT EXAMPLE2


           compare the newly created output with the sample
           output that was read from the tape;  the output
           files should be identical except for information
           about the date and time the job was executed;
           corresponding file names are:

               newly created output      example from tape
               --------------------      -----------------

                      EX1.U06              EXAMPLE1.U06
                      EX1.U19              EXAMPLE1.U19
                      EX1.U25              EXAMPLE1.U25
                      EX1.U26              EXAMPLE1.U26
                      EX1.U27              EXAMPLE1.U27
      
                      EX2.U06              EXAMPLE2.U06
                      EX2.U19              EXAMPLE2.U19


       5b. execute the command file BIGTEST.COM to compile
           and link the program and run two examples;

           BIGTEST.COM executes

              -  MAKEOBJ.COM to compile all of the source
                   code
              -  QVLINK.COM to create a new executable
                   image(the file name suffix is LDM)
              -  EXAMPLE1.COM  (unit 19 is printed)
              -  EXAMPLE2.COM  (unit 19 is printed)

           batch submittal is recommended:   $ SUBMIT BIGTEST

           BIGTEST.COM repeats step 5a's test runs using the
           newly created image;  the same output file
           comparisons as were done in step 5a.




SAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT
------------------


The user guide, QUIKVIS.TXT, contains examples of the
program input and output.  The guide should be sufficient
for a browser to determine the usefulness of the program. 


There are two complete examples of program output given on
the submittal tape.  The first is for specific targets, the
second for a grid of targets.  The first example was created
by executing the command procedure EXAMPLE1.COM, the second
by EXAMPLE2.COM.  At that time the procedures named the
output files EX1.U06, EX1.U19, EX1.U25, EX1.U26, EX1.U27,
EX2.U06, and EX2.U19.  Before the submittal tape was created,
the files were renamed EXAMPLE1.U06, ...., EXAMPLE2.U19. 
The user guide discusses the files.  The file names on the
tape are: 

          EXAMPLE1.U05       EXAMPLE2.U05 
          EXAMPLE1.U06       EXAMPLE2.U06
          EXAMPLE1.U08           n/a
          EXAMPLE1.U19       EXAMPLE2.U19
          EXAMPLE1.U25           n/a
          EXAMPLE1.U26           n/a
          EXAMPLE1.U27           n/a
          EXAMPLE1.U30       EXAMPLE2.U30




ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS
-----------------------------


All coding is in the VAX-11 FORTRAN extension to the
FORTRAN-77 standard.  VAX/VMS Version 4.2 was used
throughout, but the version number is insignigficant for
source code considerations.  Most coding was developed
using the VAX EDT's full screen editor.  Some features that
may affect transferring the program to other environments
are:

     - this program's liberal use of the VAX-11 extension is
       the most significant factor in deciding whether to
       implement QUIKVIS on another system because source
       code modifications may be required

     - many routines contain variable names with seven or
       more characters

     - inverse trig functions may have different names than
       in other environments; for example, DACOS(arc cosine)
       may be named DARCOS on other systems

     - some in-line functions(for example, JIDNNT, the
       nearest integer function for real*8 arguments) may
       have a different name on other systems

     - character strings may appear as constants in calls
       to some subroutines; for example, the form
       CALL SUB('DEMO') may be a problem

     - there are many DO WHILE loops and many DO...END DO
       loops in the code


Storage requirements in 512-byte blocks are:

     executable image ....................  853
       (see note 4, next section)

     source code (187 FOR's, 3 INC's) .... 1858
       (see note 4, next section)

     major print file ....................   56 (example 1)
       (unit 19)                            338 (example 2)

     object library ...................... 1141
       (a temporary file)






OTHER APPROPRIATE INFORMATION
-----------------------------


1) No copyrighted code is present.


2) The QUIKVIS program is one of a set of programs used for
   preflight mission planning involving remote observations.
   The set is under development and will be submitted to COSMIC
   when complete.  The set is called TOSS(for Target and Orbit
   Selection System). 


3) QUIKVIS handles only celestial objects, but program coding
   and file formats are somewhat general in anticipation of
   expansion to other objects of interest. 


4) QUIKVIS uses routines that serve several other programs in
   the library from which it was drawn.  As a result, some
   routines contain calls to lower level ones that are never
   executed during a QUIKVIS run.  All routines are present
   on the tape, whether actually executed or not, to satisfy
   all references during the link operation.  Therefore, the
   program is larger and, perhaps, slower than it would be
   if the routines were written for QUIKVIS alone.


5) The user guide was created with a text editor on the VAX. 
   All but six pages fit onto 8.5 by 11 inch paper.  The
   other six are 14 inches wide, so reproduction may involve
   reducing those pages.
