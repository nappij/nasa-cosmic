 CROSSER - CUMULATIVE BINOMIAL PROGRAMS

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     The cumulative binomial program, CROSSER, is one of a set of three pro-
grams which calculate cumulative binomial probability distributions for
arbitrary inputs. The three programs, CROSSER, CUMBIN (NPO-17555), and
NEWTONP (NPO-17556), can be used independently of one another. CROSSER can
be used by statisticians and users of statistical procedures, test plan-
ners, designers, and numerical analysts. The program has been used for re-
liability/availability calculations.

     CROSSER calculates the point at which the reliability of a k-out-of-
n system equals the common reliability of the n components. It is designed
to work well with all integer values 0 < k <= n. To run the program, the user
simply runs the executable version and inputs the information requested
by the program. The program is not designed to weed out incorrect inputs,
so the user must take care to make sure the inputs are correct. Once all in-
put has been entered, the program calculates and lists the result. It also
lists the number of iterations of Newton's method required to calculate the
answer within the given error.

     The CROSSER program is written in C. It was developed on an IBM AT with
a numeric co-processor using Microsoft C 5.0. Because the source code is
written using standard C structures and functions, it should compile cor-
rectly with most C compilers. The program format is interactive. It has
been implemented under DOS 3.2 and has a memory requirement of 26K. CROSSER
was developed in 1988.
