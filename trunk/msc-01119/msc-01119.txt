 MULTIPHASE CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM COMPOSITION

( NORTH AMERICAN AVIATION, INC. )

     This program is designed for the calculation of equilibrium composi-
tion of a complex, multiphase chemical system such as the ablation prod-
ucts of an inorganic-reinformed plastic. The method is based on the concept
of free energy minimization of the total system. It is very general and may
find applications in a diversified area. The program is designed to cover
a maximum of 12 elements in 80 gaseous and 15 condensed species. The ele-
ments currently included in this program are C, O, H, N, Si, A, Al, B, and Ca.
The temperature range is 0 to 24,000 degrees K. Also, certain thermodynamic
properties of the system are determined as by-products of the main calcula-
tions.

     This program is written in FORTRAN and has been implemented on the IBM
7094. This program was developed in 1966.
