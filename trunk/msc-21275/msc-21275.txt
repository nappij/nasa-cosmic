 VMACO-VARIABLE METRIC ALGORITHM FOR CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION

( McDonnell Douglas Corp. )

     VMACO, the Variable Metric Algorithm for Constrained Optimization, is
a non-linear program developed to calculate the least value of a function
of n variables subject to general constraints (both equality and inequal-
ity). Generally, the first set of constraints is an equality (the target)
and the remaining constraints are inequalities (boundaries). The VMACO
program utilizes an iterative method in seeking the optimal solution. It
can be "hooked" into a driver program (examples are provided) which can cal-
culate the values for the real function, constraints, and their first order
partials with respect to the controls.

     It is assumed that the objective function is convex and unimodal in na-
ture. The user should be familiar enough with his simulation so that local
maxima and minima can be recognized.

     The algorithm is based upon a variable metric method presented by M.
J. D. Powell and a quadratic programming method by R. Fletcher. This im-
plementation requires more overhead in calculating each new control vari-
able, but fewer iterations are required for convergence. In comparison
with other algorithms, it has been found that VMACO handles test cases with
constraints particularly well, and that less execution time is necessary
for convergence.

     VMACO is completely written in ANSI Standard FORTRAN-77. The code is
internally documented and modularly structured with rigid coding stan-
dards. This program requires approximately 26K of 8-bit bytes of central
memory and was first released in 1988.
