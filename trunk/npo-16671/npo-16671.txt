 ORBSIM- ESTIMATING GEOPHYSICAL MODEL PARAMETERS FROM PLANETARY GRAVITY
DATA

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     The ORBSIM program was developed for the accurate extraction of geo-
physical model parameters from Doppler radio tracking data acquired from
orbiting planetary spacecraft. The model of the proposed planetary struc-
ture is used in a numerical integration of the spacecraft along simulated
trajectories around the primary body. Using line of sight (LOS) Doppler
residuals, ORBSIM applies fast and efficient modelling and optimization
procedures which avoid the traditional complex dynamic reduction of data.
ORBSIM produces quantitative geophysical results such as size, depth, and
mass. ORBSIM has been used extensively to investigate topographic features
on the Moon, Mars, and Venus. The program has proven particulary suitable
for modelling gravitational anomalies and mascons.

     The basic observable for spacecraft-based gravity data is the Doppler
frequency shift of a transponded radio signal. The time derivative of this
signal carries information regarding the gravity field acting on the space-
craft in the LOS direction (the LOS direction being the path between the
spacecraft and the receiving station, either Earth or another satellite).
There are many dynamic factors taken into account: earth rotation, so-
lar radiation, acceleration from planetary bodies, tracking station time
and location adjustments, etc. The actual trajectories of the spacecraft
are simulated using least squares fitted to conic motion. The theoretical
Doppler readings from the simulated orbits are compared to actual Doppler
observations and another least squares adjustment is made. ORBSIM has
three modes of operation: trajectory simulation, optimization, and grav-
ity modelling. In all cases, an initial gravity model of curved and/or flat
disks, harmonics, and/or a force table are required input.

     ORBSIM is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch execution and has been imple-
mented on a DEC VAX 11/780 computer operating under VMS. This program was
released in 1985.
