 PROGRAMMABLE DISPLAY PUSHBUTTON LEGEND EDITOR

( NASA Langley Research Center )

     The Programmable Display Pushbutton (PDP) is a pushbutton device
available from Micro Switch which has a programmable 16 x 35 matrix of LEDs
on the pushbutton surface. Any desired legends can be displayed on the
PDPs, producing user-friendly applications which greatly reduce the need
for dedicated manual controls. Because the PDP can interact with the opera-
tor, it can call for the correct response before transmitting its next mes-
sage. It is both a simple manual control and a sophisticated programmable
link between the operator and the host system.

     The Programmable Display Pushbutton Legend Editor, PDPE, is used to
create the LED displays for the pushbuttons. PDPE encodes PDP control com-
mands and legend data into message byte strings sent to a Logic Refresh and
Control Unit (LRCU). The LRCU serves as the driver for a set of four PDPs.
The legend editor (PDPE) transmits to the LRCU user specified commands that
control what is displayed on the LED face of the individual pushbuttons.
Upon receiving a command, the LRCU transmits an acknowledgement that the
message was received and executed successfully. The user then observes the
effect of the command on the PDP displays and decides whether or not to send
the byte code of the message to a data file so that it may be called by an ap-
plications program.

     The PDPE program is written in FORTRAN for interactive execution. It
was developed on a DEC VAX 11/780 under VMS. It has a central memory require-
ment of approximately 12800 bytes. It requires four Micro Switch PDPs and
two RS-232 VAX 11/780 terminal ports. The PDPE program was developed in
1985.
