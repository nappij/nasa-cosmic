 NASA ARCH- A FILE ARCHIVAL SYSTEM FOR THE DEC VAX

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     The function of the NASA ARCH system is to provide a permanent storage
area for files that are infrequently accessed. The NASA ARCH routines were
designed to provide a simple mechanism by which users can easily store and
retrieve files. The user treats NASA ARCH as the interface to a black box
where files are stored. There are only five NASA ARCH user commands, even
though NASA ARCH employs standard VMS directives and the VAX BACKUP util-
ity. Special care is taken to provide the security needed to insure file in-
tegrity over a period of years.

     The archived files may exist in any of three storage areas: a tempo-
rary buffer, the main buffer, and a magnetic tape library. When the main
buffer fills up, it is transferred to permanent magnetic tape storage and
deleted from disk. Files may be restored from any of the three storage ar-
eas. A single file, multiple files, or entire directories can be stored
and retrieved. archived entities hold the same name, extension, version
number, and VMS file protection scheme as they had in the user's account
prior to archival. NASA ARCH is capable of handling up to 7 directory lev-
els. Wildcards are supported. User commands include TEMPCOPY, DISKCOPY,
DELETE, RESTORE, and DIRECTORY. The DIRECTORY command searches a direc-
tory of savesets covering all three archival areas, listing matches ac-
cording to area, date, filename, or other criteria supplied by the user.
The system manager commands include 1) ARCHIVE- to transfer the main buffer
to duplicate magnetic tapes, 2) REPORTto determine when the main buffer is
full enough to archive, 3) INCREMENT- to back up the partially filled main
buffer, and 4) FULLBACKUP- to back up the entire main buffer. On-line help
files are provided for all NASA ARCH commands.

     NASA ARCH is written in DEC VAX DCL for interactive execution and has
been implemented on a DEC VAX computer operating under VMS 4.X. This program
was developed in 1985.
