 GENERALIZED DIGITAL CONTOURING PROGRAM

( NASA Langley Research Center )

     This is a digital computer contouring program developed by combining
desirable characteristics from several existing contouring programs. It
can easily be adapted to many different research requirements. The over-
laid structure of the program permits desired modifications to be made with
ease.

     The contouring program performs both the task of generating a depth ma-
trix from either randomly or regularly spaced surface heights and the task
of contouring the data. Each element of the depth matrix is computed as a
weighted mean of heights predicted at an element by planes tangent to the
surface at neighboring control points. Each contour line is determined by
its intercepts with the sides of geometrical figures formed by connecting
the various elements of the depth matrix with straight lines.

     Although contour charts are usually thought of as being two-
dimensional pictorial representations of topographic formations of land
masses, they can also be useful in portraying data which are obtained during
the course of research in various scientific disciplines and which would
ordinarily be tabulated. Any set of data which can be referenced to a two-
dimensional coordinate system can be graphically represented by this pro-
gram.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV and ASSEMBLER for batch execution
and has been implemented on the CDC 6000 Series. This program was developed
in 1971.
