 OPTICAL LENS PRESCRIPTION DATA REFORMATTER

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     The Optical Lens Prescription Data Formatter allows the user to
quickly and easily transfer complicated optical lens prescriptions from
one major optical design program to another and back again. Thus one may
take advantage of the inherent strengths of either program. The programs
are ACCOS V from Scientific Calculations, Inc. of Fishers, NY, and CODE V
from Optical Research Associates of Pasadena, CA.

     The translation program works quite well for most lens prescriptions.
On all tested lenses it correctly translates the lens radii, thickness,
polynomial aspheric data, tilts, decenters, and aperature sizes. Limita-
tions occur for special types of surfaces and some data pickups because the
programs are not fully equivalent. In these cases the program translates
all the data it can and prints comments mentioning the rest. The user can
then manually adjust the lens to correctly model the system.

     This program is written in FORTRAN and requires 64K bytes of 8 bit bytes
but has been fully tested in only one direction -- ACCOS V to CODE V. At some
installations, differences in lens data files may require modification of
format statements. This program was released in 1987.
