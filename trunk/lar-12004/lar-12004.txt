 AEROELASTIC DIVERGENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF UNGUIDED, SLENDER BODY, MULTI-
STAGE LAUNCH VEHICLES

( NASA Langley Research Center )

     The primary function of this computer program is the calculation of the
divergence dynamic pressure and associated divergence modal character-
istics of unguided, slender-body, multistage launch vehicles. The diver-
gence dynamic pressure is obtained as the non-trivial solution to a homoge-
nous stability equation using matrix recurrence techniques. Provision is
made for modulating the distributed lift curve coefficient slope function
and the stiffness function. The program also includes an option for calcu-
lating a generalized static margin which approximates the degeneration in
rigid-body static margin due to aeroelasticity effects. Evaluated equa-
tions are also programmed to allow for the exclusion of the effect of aero-
dynamic crossflow resulting from vehicle angular velocities if desired.
Other physical and aerodynamic properties calculated include total mass,
center of mass, moments of inertia in pitch about the reference station, to-
tal aerodynamic lift curve slope, static aerodynamic center of pressure,
rigid body static margin, and short period frequency. Input to the program
is via the Fortran NAMELIST option with output printed.

     The program is written in CDC Fortran IV (Version 2.3) and has been im-
plemented on a CDC 6600 computer under the SCOPE 3.2 monitor in central mem-
ory field lengths less than 57K octal 60 bit words.
