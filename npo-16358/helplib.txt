                       is shown on the screen (i.e. FORTRAN carriage-
                       control, and all printer control will work as

1 EXCLAMATION
          !          - set reverse switch, all commands will now work
                       in reverse (i.e. n$ will jump -n lines, etc.)

          "string"   - clear the search buffers and save the given
                       string as the only search string.  A string
                       can consist of any characters, to include a
                       quotation mark (") one must put two of them in
                       a row ("").
1 '
          'string' 'string' ...
                     - add the given string(s) to the search buffers.

                        idual commands a1, a2,..., a10.  Up to 10 com-
                        mands can be defined (to execute in sequence)
                        for a symbol (excluding any "string" or 'string'
                        commands (for loading the search buffers)).
                        If a line ends in a minus sign the next line is
                        considered a continuation of it and is prompted
                        for by -.  Continuation lines are appended to
                        the previous line(s) without the insertion of
                        any delimeters.

                        NOTE:  Definitions which load the search buffers
                               with strings and execute NO searches will
                               not perform correctly.

                        names (WIDE is the same as NONARROW),

2 WRAP
          SET WRAP    - causes lines to long for the screen to be
