 CUMBIN - CUMULATIVE BINOMIAL PROGRAMS

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     The cumulative binomial program, CUMBIN, is one of a set of three pro-
grams which calculate cumulative binomial probability distributions for
arbitrary inputs. The three programs, CUMBIN, NEWTONP (NPO-17556), and
CROSSER (NPO-17557), can be used independently of one another. CUMBIN can
be used by statisticians and users of statistical procedures, test plan-
ners, designers, and numerical analysts. The program has been used for re-
liability/availability calculations.

     CUMBIN calculates the probability that a system of n components has
at least k operating if the probability that any one operating is p and the
components are independent. Equivalently, this is the reliability of a k-
out-of-n system having independent components with common reliability p.
CUMBIN can evaluate the incomplete beta distribution for two positive inte-
ger arguments. CUMBIN can also evaluate the cumulative F distribution and
the negative binomial distribution, and can determine the sample size in a
test design. CUMBIN is designed to work well with all integer values 0 < k <=
n. To run the program, the user simply runs the executable version and in-
puts the information requested by the program. The program is not designed
to weed out incorrect inputs, so the user must take care to make sure the in-
puts are correct. Once all input has been entered, the program calculates
and lists the result.

     The CUMBIN program is written in C. It was developed on an IBM AT with
a numeric co-processor using Microsoft C 5.0. Because the source code is
written using standard C structures and functions, it should compile cor-
rectly with most C compilers. The program format is interactive. It has
been implemented under DOS 3.2 and has a memory requirement of 26K. CUMBIN
was developed in 1988.
