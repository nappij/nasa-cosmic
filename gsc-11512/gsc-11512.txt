 GREMEX- GODDARD RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT EXERCISE SIMULATION
SYSTEM

( NASA Goddard Space Flight Center )

     GREMEX is a man-machine management simulation game of a research and
development project. It can be used to depict a project from just after the
development of the project plan through the final construction phase. The
GREMEX computer programs are basically a program evaluation and review
technique (PERT) reporting system. In the usual PERT program, the opera-
tor inputs each month the amount of work performed on each activity and the
computer does the bookkeeping to determine the expected completion date
of the project. GREMEX automatically assumes that all activities due to be
worked in the current month will be worked. GREMEX predicts new durations
(and costs) each month based on management actions taken by the players and
the contractor's abilities. Each activity is assigned the usual cost and
duration estimates but must also be assigned three parameters that relate
to the probability that the time estimate is correct, the probability that
the cost estimate is correct, and the probability of technical success.
Management actions usually can be expected to change these probabilities.
For example, use of overtime or double shifts in research and development
work will decrease duration and increase cost by known proportions and will
also decrease the probability of technical success due to an increase in the
likelihood of accidents or mistakes. These re-estimating future events and
assigning probability factors provides life to the model.

     GREMEX is not a production job for project management. GREMEX is a game
that can be used to train management personnel in the administration of re-
search and development type projects. GREMEX poses no 'best way' to man-
age a project. The emphasis of GREMEX is to expose participants to many of
the factors involved in decision making when managing a project in a gov-
ernment research and development environment. A management team can win
the game by surpassing cost, schedule, and technical performance goals es-
tablished when the simulation began. The serious management experimenter
can use GREMEX to explore the results of management methods they could not
risk in real life. GREMEX can operate with any research and development
type project with up to 15 subcontractors and produces reports simulating
monthly or quarterly updates of the project PERT network. Included with the
program is a data deck for simulation of a fictitious spacecraft project.
Instructions for substituting other projects are also included.

     GREMEX is written in FORTRAN IV for execution in the batch mode and has
been implemented on an IBM 360 with a central memory requirement of approx-
imately 350K (decimal) of 8 bit bytes. The GREMEX system was developed in
1973.
