 ANALYSIS OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL SUPERSONIC NOZZLE EXHAUST FLOW FIELDS

( ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY LABS. )

     A second order numerical method employing reference plane character-
istics has been developed for the calculation of geometrically complex
three dimensional nozzle-exhaust flow fields, heretofore uncalculable by
existing methods. The nozzles may have irregular cross sections with swept
throats and may be stacked in modules using the vehicle undersurface for ad-
ditional expansion. The nozzles may have highly nonuniform entrance con-
ditions, the medium considered being an equilibrium hydrogen-air mixture.
The program calculates and carries along the underexpansion shock and con-
tact as discrete discontinuity surfaces, for a nonuniform vehicle external
flow. Additionally, shock formation due to coalescence is detected. A wide
variety of geometric problems may be considered since the reference plane
method has been developed for three separate coordinate systems, all incor-
porated into a single program.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been
implemented on a CDC 6000 Series computer. This program was developed in
1972.
