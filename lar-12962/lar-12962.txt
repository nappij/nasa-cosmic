 THREE DIMENSIONAL NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR FLOW OVER NONAXISYMMETRIC
NOZZLE CONFIGURATIONS

( LOCKHEED MISSILES & SPACE CO. )

     A set of computer codes has been developed for solving the three-
dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for the flow over nonaxisymmetric
nozzle configurations. The objective in developing these codes was to be
able to compute the internal and external viscous flowfield about an iso-
lated nozzle, so that the flow characteristics and performance of three-
dimensional jet engine exhaust nozzles could be predicted. The approach is
based on using an efficient implicit numerical method to solve the unsteady
Navier-Stokes equations in a boundary-conforming curvilinear coordinate
system to obtain the desired time-asymptotic steady-state solution. Flow
turbulence effects are simulated by means of algebraic turbulence models
for the effective turbulent eddy viscosity and Prandlt number.

     This set of codes consists of three programs. The RGRIDD program con-
structs a boundary-conforming curvilinear coordinate system and computa-
tional grid for complicated three-dimensional nozzle configurations. The
NOZLIC program can construct simple coordinate systems and grids for two-
dimensional or axisymmetric converging-diverging nozzles and generates
the initial conditions for the NOZL3D code. The NOZL3D program performs an
implicit numerical solution to the spatially parabolized form of the three-
dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes equations in general curvilinear coor-
dinates.

     The NOZL3D program obtains its solution in the following manner. The
three-dimensional flow region is represented by a computational space that
consists of a rectangular parallelepiped. This computational space is cov-
ered with a rectangular grid of nodal points that are equally spaced in each
of the three coordinate directions in the space.

     Finite-difference analogs of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations are
solved on this grid by an implicit numerical method that advances the so-
lution over a sequence of time steps using a "sweeping" procedure to obtain
the final steady-state solution.

     These programs are written in FORTRAN IV and ASSEMBLER. There are both
batch and interactive versions of the RGRIDD program each having a central
memory requirement of approximately 60K (octal) of 60 bit words. The NO-
ZLIC and NOZL3D are intended for batch execution. Both "disc" and "core"
versions of NOZLIC and NOZL3D are supplied. The disc versions have been im-
plemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with central memory require-
ments of approximately 140K (octal) and 175 (octal) of 60 bit words respec-
tively. The core versions are for implementation on CDC 7600 or CDC 203 com-
puters and have problem dependent central memory requirements. These pro-
grams were developed in 1980.
