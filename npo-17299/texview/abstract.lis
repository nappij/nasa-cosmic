ABSTRACT

1.	This program facilitates the production of viewgraphs.  It does
	so using TeX, a public-domain typesetting language developed by
	Dr. Donald Knuth of Stanford University, now widely used throughout
	the scientific and educational community.  TeXVIEW defines an 
	environment and macros for producing viewgraphs that unburden
	the user of typesetting considerations.

2.	TeXVIEW is machine- and output-device-independent.  It is set
	up for a specific viewgraph environment that matches that used
	at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory exactly.  It would be trivial
	to modify it for other institutional formats.  The inclusion of
	graphics is allowed by an implementation-specific command that
	may not exist or be in the same format on other systems; however,
	it will be very easy to convert in such an instance.

	                                                  


REQUIREMENTS:

1.	The problem: produce viewgraphs without the user having to
	specify endless complicated formatting commands.

2.	The solution: a series of TeX macros and output routines
	that set up an environment for producing viewgraphs, and
	a series of simple commands oriented towards functions
	required in viewgraphs.

3.	Language: TeX, with optional command procedures and command
	definition files for producing a high-speed version when run
	under VAX/VMS.

Size:     900 lines of TeX
          10 lines of DCL
          10 lines of VAX Command Definition Language      

4.	Machine requirements: none.  If the user wishes to implement the
	preloaded format, you need a VAX computer and the VMS operating
	system to take advantage of the supplied routines; however these
	are so short that they could easily be used on another machine
	which supplies the same functionality.

5.	User instructions: See the file MANUAL.TEX, which is coded in
	TeXVIEW instructions.  Process it through TeXVIEW in order to
	generate the manual.  If you do not have the high-speed version,
	insert the command "\input texview" at the head of the file
	to load the TeXVIEW routines.

6.	Operating instructions: with the high-speed version, simply
	define the commands as specified in the file README. and type
	TEXVIEW input_file.  Otherwise insert the command "\input texview"
	at the head of the input file and type TEX input_file.

Sample input and output: the file MANUAL.TEX and the result of passing
it through TeXVIEW supply these.
