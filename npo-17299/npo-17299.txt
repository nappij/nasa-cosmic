 TEXVIEW- PRODUCTION OF VIEWGRAPHS WITH TEX

( Cal Tech/Jet Propulsion Lab. )

     TEXVIEW is a package of TEX macros that facilitate viewgraph produc-
tion. TEXVIEW is based on TEX, a public domain typesetting language devel-
oped by Dr. Donald Knuth of Stanford University. The TEXVIEW macros are
grouped into the following categories: format control; indentation con-
trol; font control; spacing control; graphical control; and page layout.

     TEXVIEW is written in TEX. Optional command procedures and command
definition files for producing a high speed version when run under VAX/VMS
are included. Although implemented on a VAX under VMS 4.X, TEXVIEW is ma-
chine and output device independent. This program was developed in 1987 and
updated in 1989.
