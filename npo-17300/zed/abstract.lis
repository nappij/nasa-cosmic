ABSTRACT

1.	We found that screen editors had two inherent flaws: executing
	complex multiple or conditional commands or batch processing
	with fixed editing commands was cumbersome and inefficient, and
	editing via slow modem lines was tedious.  The ZED editor
	provides a simple yet powerful interface for line editing.

2.	The program has only rudimentary support for exotic file types,
	yet handles most file types correctly.  There is no full-screen
	interface and no regular expression matching, yet there are
	more search qualifiers than usually available with text editors.
	ZED provides powerful global editing commands, conditional
	commands (including multi-way conditional commands), "whenever"
	commands, boolean combinations of search expressions, and versatile
	search qualifiers.



REQUIREMENTS

1.	Problem: provide a simple interface for performing powerful
	complicated edits of text files, and for editing efficiently
	via slow modem lines.

2.	Solution: ZED is a line-based editor with a simple and concise
	syntax, yet capable of arbitrary complexity of processing in
	expert hands.

3.	Program language: C.  Source code is supplied.  Length: 6500 lines.
                                                                           
4.	Machine requirements: a VAX computer running VMS.  However, with
	very little modification, ZED will run under any system, e.g. Unix.

5.	User instructions: a complete specification (about 60 pages) is
	supplied in printer format.  TeX source is provided for a quick-
	reference card and a tutorial, which are included in the
	documentation.

6.	Operating instructions: install the command via the ZED.CLD
	command definition file and then edit files using the command
	syntax defined in the documentation.
