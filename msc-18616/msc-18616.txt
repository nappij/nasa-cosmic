 TPS MULTIDIMENSIONAL HEAT CONDUCTION PROGRAM

( ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP. )

     The Thermal Protection System (TPS) for the Space Shuttle consists of
an outer layer of rigid surface insulation tiles. It is important that an
accurate understanding of the thermal behavior of this system be obtained
prior to usage. This computer program was developed to compute the tran-
sient temperature history and the steady-state temperatures of complex
body geometries in three dimensions. Emphasis has been placed on the type
of problems associated with the TPS, but the program could be used in the
thermal analysis of most three-dimensional systems.

     The thermal model is subdivided into sections, or nodes, to a level of
approximation which yields the desired level of accuracy. Input to the pro-
gram consists of a geometrical description of the physical system, the ma-
terial properties, and selected boundary conditions. The boundary con-
ditions are used to account for heat flux, reradiation, radiation inter-
change, convection, fixed temperatures, and phase changes. The program
will accomodate a thermal model with as many as 500 nodes, 4000 conductors,
3600 radiation interchange conductors, and 75 of each type of boundary con-
dition. The program solves the differential equations describing the tran-
sient and steady state behavior of the model using finite difference tech-
niques. For the transient analysis, the user may select either a forward
difference method, a midpoint difference (Crank-Nicolson) method, a back-
ward difference method, or an alternating direction method to numerically
solve the governing equations. For the steady-state analysis, a modified
backward difference method is available. Program output is in the form of
temperature versus time histories for each section of the thermal model.

     This program is available in both IBM and CDC machine versions. The IBM
version is written in FORTRAN IV and OS ASSEMBLER for batch execution and
has been implemented on an IBM 370 series computer with a central memory re-
quirement of approximately 450K of 8 bit bytes. The CDC version is written
in all FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on a CDC CYBER
170 series computer with a segmented memory requirement of approximately
230K (octal) of 60 bit words. This heat conduction program was originally
developed in 1976 with the latest update occuring in 1979.
