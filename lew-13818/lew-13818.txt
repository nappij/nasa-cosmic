 GRID3O- FAST GENERATION OF MULTILEVEL, THREE-DIMENSIONAL BOUNDARY-
CONFORMING O-TYPE COMPUTATIONAL GRIDS

( NASA Lewis Research Center )

     A fast algorithm has been developed for accurately generating
boundary-conforming, three-dimensional consecutively refined compu-
tational grids applicable to arbitrary wing-body and axial turbomachin-
ery geometries. This algorithm has been incorporated into the GRID3O com-
puter program. The method employed in GRID3O is based on using an analytic
function to generate two-dimensional grids on a number of coaxial axisym-
metric surfaces positioned between the centerbody and the outer radial
boundary. These grids are of the O-type and are characterized by quasi-
orthogonality, geometric periodicity, and an adequate resolution through-
out the flow field. Because the built-in nonorthogonal coordinate stretch-
ing and shearing cause the grid lines leaving the blade or wing trailing-
edge to end at downstream infinity, use of the generated grid simplifies the
numerical treatment of three-dimensional trailing vortex sheets.

     The GRID3O program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has
been implemented on an IBM 370 series computer with a central memory re-
quirement of approximately 450K of 8 bit bytes. The GRID3O program was de-
veloped in 1981.
