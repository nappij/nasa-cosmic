 GENERAL FLOW DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM

( ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP. )

     The General Flow Distribution Program was developed to analyze pres-
sure drops and flow distribution in closed and open hydraulic systems. The
program analyzes a system on the basis of incompressible flow even though
the system may contain either compressible or incompressible fluid. The
program has been used to analyze such orbiter hydraulic systems as the Air
Revitalization System in the Environmental Control and Life Support Sys-
tem. The General Flow Distribution Program is capable of solving fixed or
variable flow problems for series, parallel, or series-parallel systems.

     A flow system is represented by a nodal network with elements of flow
resistance. Either a closed network with pumps and fans or an open network
with a known total fixed flow rate may be analyzed. Adjustment of variables
is permitted through the use of user supplied routines. The analytical
method employed is generally based on the successive approximation method.
Flow across a resistance, which may either be a duct, tube, or a black box
with known characteristics, is calculated using the Bernoulli pressure
drop equation. Starting with assumed pressures at active nodes, the pro-
gram iteratively corrects the pressures and flows until pressure and flow
balance tests are satisfied. The balanced pressure drops and flows com-
puted are output as analysis results.

     This program is written in FORTRAN V for batch execution and has been
implemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer. As currently dimensioned
to accommodate a network of up to 500 nodes and 1000 line elements, the pro-
gram has a central memory requirement of approximately 77K (octal) of 60 bit
words. This program was developed in 1980.
