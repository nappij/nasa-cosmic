              Chapters 6 through 9 present information relevant to the 
         maintenance or enhancement of SCAT.  The following chapters de- 
         scribe in detail why SCAT evolved into its present configuration, 
         how the software works and how to modify the existing software.  
         All information is written for the software maintainer and not the 
         SCAT user.  It is not necessary to know the information in chap- 
         ters 6 through 9 to operate SCAT. 
     
              The maintenance manual assumes the reader has knowledge of 
         and/or access to documentation on VAX VMS DCL, VAX FORTRAN, Boeing 
         RIM, MS-DOS, Microsoft FORTRAN,  MicroRIM R:base 5000, and the 
         R:base 5000 Program Interface package.

              Certain restrictions were placed on SCAT because of NASA re- 
         quirements and the developer's goals.  These restrictions and 
         goals shaped SCAT into the software package that it has become.  
         The following sections will explain the design decisions, the rea- 
         soning behind them and the effect they have had on the software 
         development. 
      
              6.1   SCAT ENVIRONMENT GOALS
-
         
              SCAT was designed and developed to aid system engineers in 
         performing commonality analysis on space items.  SCAT is intended 
         to be used initially on the design and development of the space 
         station, but not limited to the Space Station in use or 
         application. 
          
              The following design goals were the basis for SCAT and dic- 
         tated or influenced all decisions regarding the execution and pro- 
         gram structure of SCAT. 
           
          1)  Utilization of Vendor Software:  Whenever possible commer- 
              cially available software was to be used.  The development 
              effort was to be directed at commonality analysis and not in 
              duplicating capabilities that exist in commercially avail- 
              able packages. 
            
          2)  Flexible:  SCAT must be able to accommodate a wide variety of     
                 
              items, limited in scope only by the creativity of the user. 
             
          3)  Interactive:  A user must be able to sit at a terminal and 
              receive information on the commonality potential of space 
              items. 
              
          4)  Quick response time:  SCAT must provide responses quickly, to 
              hold the attention of the user. 
              
          5)  Easy to use:  Non-computer oriented individuaof the file to store your data in.  It can not
  be the same name as the file being processed.

       Filenames are from 1-8 characters in length, and can be followed
  a file name extension.  The following characters can be used for
  file names:


  PC  :          A-Z 0-9 $ & # @ ! % ' ` ( ) - { } _ / \


  VAX :          A-Z 0-9 _

  Any other characters are invalid.

          8)  On-line help:  SCAT must have a facility that would answer 
              the most common questions a user might have without forcing 
              him to go to a secondary reference source. 
    
          9)  User friendly:  SCAT should trap all invalid inputs, inform 
              the user that an invalid input has been entered, indicate 
              what the allowable inputs are and re-prompt the user for a 
              valid input.  Should the user enter a correct but inappropri- 
              ate input, the user must have the capability to backtrack  
              and re-enter the desired value.  
     
         10)  Robust:  Execution of SCAT should never terminate unexpect- 
              edly. 
      
         11)  Two versions:  A mainframe (VAX) and a microcomputer (PC) 
              version of SCAT were to be developed.  Both versions should 
              execute as identically as possible.  A user of one system 
              should not have to be retrained to use the other system. 
       
         
              6.2   SOFTWARE RESTRICTIONS
                      
              In order to remain compatible with existing and planned space 
         station data bases at NASA MSFC in Huntsville, Alabama, certain 
         software packages were dictated.  Other software packages were re- 
         quired to interface with these specified packages. 
            
              Dictated Packages:  Boeing RIM (Relational Information            
              
         Management) was to be used by the VAX version for the data base 
         functions.  MicroRIM R:base 5000 (which is compatible with RIM) 
         was to be used by the microcomputer version for the data base 
         functions. 
             
              Required Packages:  The MicroRIM Program Interface Package 
         (PI) was required to interface to R:base 5000.  Microsoft Fortran 
         was required because MicroRIM's PI is supplied as a Microsoft For- 
         tran library.  On the mainframe Fortran was thus required to 
         minimize differences between the two versions. 
              
              Additional restrictions were placed on the Fortran code de- 
         veloped to ease program development and maintenance.  The code in 
         the two versions was to be as identical as possible.  Standard 
         Fortran 77 syntax and structures were to be used over specialized 

                 
                                       6 - 4

         features of either system.  Features or capabilities that exist in 
         only one of the operating systems, data base packages or Fortran 
         compilers were to be avoided.  Code that required specific hard- 
         ware (i.e. specific plotters, printers, terminals, etc.) was to be 
         avoided whenever possible. 

              It should be noted that while the above restrictions greatly 
         simplified the development effort and maintainability issues, they 
         also very effectively prevented the utilization of any of the 
         unique capabilities of either system.  Consequently, experienced 
         programmers may question why certain system functions which would 
         make the program more efficient and simpler to understand were 
         omitted from SCAT.  On closer inspection they will see that only 
         one of the versions had that particular function available to it.  
   
              For example, the mainframe data base package (RIM) has the 
         capability of storing large numbers of attributes in a given table 
         but has limited I/O features while the micro data base package 
         (R:base 5000) limits the size of rows of data in tables to 1530 
         characters and has elaborate I/O capabilities.  The mentioned con- 
         tradictions dictated that the width of tables in SCAT would be 
         limited in both versions, and the I/O capabilities of R:base 5000 
         could not be utilized.

         with definite hardware configurations and capacities.  These hard- 
         ware configurations are commonly found in industry and coincide 
         with configurations of hardware used at NASA MSFC.  The hardware 
         requirements are: 
          
               Mainframe:  Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX 11/780 
         operating under VMS.  The terminal control software was developed 
         for a DEC VT100 or VT220, but any terminal that can operate in VT100 
         or VT220 mode should suffice.  The printer must have 132 character
         width capability.  No other special devices (plotters, mouse, light 
         pen, etc.) are required or supported.

               Microcomputer:  IBM PC/XT with 640K of RAM, fixed hard disk 
         with a 10MB or larger hard disk storage device.  SCAT uses 
         standard ANSI control sequences for clearing the screen and 
         placing the cursor in the upper left corner of the screen.  The 
         printer should accept standard IBM control sequences for condensed 
         print (char 15), 132 character width (char 27, 'Q', char 132), 
         form feed (char 12), and reset parameters to default (char 27, 
         '@').  No other special devices (plotters, mouse, light pen, etc.) 
         are required or supported.
