          The options under the System Utilities Menu allow you to ex-
     ecute system commands, run other programs from within SCAT and          
     transfer data bases, data base structures, or SCAT data between        
     different systems. 

          From the main menu select option three "SCAT SYSTEM        
     UTILITIES".  The System Utilities Menu will then appear on the        
     screen as shown in Figure 5.0-1.  On the VAX version option two of        
     the System Utilities Menu is labeled "RUN RIM".

     5.1   EXECUTING AN OPERATING SYSTEM COMMAND
                   
          Any operating system command including running another pro-
     gram can be executed from within SCAT.  As soon as the command has        
     finished executing control will return to SCAT.  The only restric-        
     tion in the PC version is the amount of memory available for the        
     command.  SCAT remains resident in memory at all times and takes        
     up approximately 270K bytes of memory.  If there are no other        
     resident programs this leaves about 330K left for other commands        
     on a 640K machine (DOS uses up about 35K at all times).  The VAX        
     version does not have any limitations.









                                   5 - 1

          From the System Utilities Menu select option one "EXECUTE AN       
     OPERATING SYSTEM COMMAND".  SCAT will then prompt for a system        
     command as shown if Figure 5.1-1.  At this point, the command to        
     be executed is entered.

*
            DO YOU WISH TO MODIFY THE PREVIOUS SELECTION CRITERIA?



       SCAT has been given a select criteria.  If you want to modify the
   existing selection criteria answer "Y". If you want to define a whole new
   selection criteria from scratch answer "N" or press <Return>.

       If you don't answer either "Y" or "N", SCAT will assume that you wantle called TEMP.DOC.  When the editor is exited        
     execution will be returned to the same prompt shown in Figure        
     5.1-1.  At that point another system command can be executed or        
     you can return to the System Utilities Menu by pressing the <ESC>        
     key.


     5.2   RUNNING R:BASE/RIM

          SCAT's data files are compatible with RIM on the VAX and
     R:base on the PC.  Experienced RIM/R:base users can utilize the
     data base package capabilities directly for data entry, data
     modification, report generation and other advanced operations. 
     For more infor-mation on the structure of SCAT data files see Ap-
     pendix C.  For more information on the data base packages see the
     appropriate manual.

          From the System Utilities Menu select option two "RUN R:BASE        
     5000".  SCAT will then invoke R:base (RIM on the VAX).  All of the        
     functions available in the data base package are then available as        
     though the data base package was invoked from the operating system        
     prompt.  Parameters set within SCAT (data base name, password,        
     etc.) do not carry over to the data base package.  When the data        
     base package is finished control will be returned to SCAT.


     5.3   UNLOADING A DATA BASE

          The "UNLOAD DATA BASE" option provides the capability to        
     share data bases, data base structures and data from the micro        
     version of SCAT to the VAX version and vice versa.  Because of        
     differences between R:base and RIM the data base files of the two        
     versions are not directly transportable.





                                   5 - 2


          In order to transfer information between the two versions it        
     is necessary to unload the desired information to a text file in        
     the proper format and then to input information in that file to        
     the other system.  By selecting and sorting the data before un-        
     loading it you have the ability to create new subset data bases        
     from an existing data base.

          From the System Utilities Menu select option three "UNLOAD        
     DATA BASE."  Menu 3.3 will then be displayed on the screen as        
     shown in Figure 5.3-1.

          Options 1 through 4 work in exactly the same way as the cor-        
     responding options in the Commonality Analysis menu.  For help on        
     options 1 - 4 refer to Chapter 3.  The selection and sort criteria        
     that are defined for a data base with the options in this menu de-        
     fine the items (rows of data) that will be unloaded and the order        
     in which they will be unloaded.  To unload all data from a data        
     base do not define a selection criteria.

     The file must contain valid RIM/R:BASE commands.  If the file was created
 with the SCAT UNLOAD utility there should be no problems with the content of
 the file.  The VAX version will accept 7 characters max for the file name.
 The micro version will accept a file name with a maximum of 20 characters,
 including path names and extensions.  The extension .DAT is the default,

     load the entire data base (structure and data) or just the data        
     base structure.  The data base structure consists of the attribute        
     names, type and their corresponding descriptions.

     This feature is useful for transporting data bases or data between        
     the two versions of SCAT.  When this option is selected the fol-
