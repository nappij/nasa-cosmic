1 STRIP72

STRIP72 is a program that removes all characters after column 72 and all 
trailing blanks from an input file.  It is useful for removing the identi-
fication field from FORTRAN and DATA files.

Enter:   STRIP72 filespec

where 'filespec' is the name of the file to be stripped.  A new version of
'filespec' will be created.
