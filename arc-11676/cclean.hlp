1 CCLEAN

CCLEAN is a program to clean up COMMON blocks in a FORTRAN program. It is
particularly helpful after using TIDY.

Enter:   CCLEAN filespec

where filespec is the name of the FORTRAN file, less the .FOR suffix. A new
version of filespec will be created.  See MERLIN:CCLEAN.DOC for more info.
