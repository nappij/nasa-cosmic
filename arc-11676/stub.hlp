1 STUB

STUB is a program which creates a FORTRAN file containing subprogram stubs,
using the FORTRAN 77 programming standards format for the prologues. An option
to enter identical code in each subprogram is provided. See [MERLIN]STUB.DOC
for more information.

Enter:   STUB filespec

where filespec is the name of the FORTRAN file to be created, less the .FOR
suffix.
