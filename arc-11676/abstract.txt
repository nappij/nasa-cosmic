The FORTRAN Programming Tools are a series of tools used to support the
development and maintenance of FORTRAN source codes.  Included are a debugging
aid, source code maintenance aids, print utilities, a CPU time monitoring
program, a NAMELIST-like package, and a library of useful, well-documented
routines.  These tools assist in reducing development time and encouraging high
quality programs. Although intended for FORTRAN users, some of the tools can be
used on data files or other programming languages.
