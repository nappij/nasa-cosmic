*  INTRODUCTION  *
******************





The TOSS target catalogue is a data file containing data about objects,
places, and regions. The data is to be operated upon in some way,
usually in computing observation information. The catalogue data
consists of: 

        - the target ID

        - the target name

        - an indicator telling what kind of target this is

        - location data for certain kinds of targets

        - miscellaneous data for certain kinds of targets



Typically, programs follow the following sequence:

        1) Indicate which targets are of interest, or specify 'ALL'

           Some programs may use the Observation Requirements File
           to define the targets, others may use direct user input.
           The requirements file is read via subroutine RDEXP.

        2) Retrieve target information from the catalogue

           Programs retrieve target information from the catalogue
           using a reader, RDCAT.  This format description assumed
           that RDCAT will be used to retrieve the data.

        3) Use TGLOC to get the target location in the coordinate system
           appropriate for the problem

        4) Use the target coordinates as required by the problem.

The file format is given below. The target catalogue is a text file
suitable for text-editing and for reading in a list-directed manner.


        BE SURE TO END EACH TARGET'S DATA WITH A SLASH(/).

  VARIABLE   DIM  TYPE  DESCRIPTION
  --------   ---  ----  -----------

  IDTARG      1   I*4   This is the target I.D.  An integer quantity.
                        There are no reserved I.D.'s, so any convenient
                        one will do.

                        RESTRICTION:

                          Target ID's must be in ascending order
                          on the file, but gaps in the sequence are
                          permitted. Target ID's may not be repeated.
                          Violation is an error and RDCAT will stop
                          the program.

                        If the TOSS observation requirements file is
                        being used, IDTARG is the same as the target
                        I.D. used there.

                        Records with zero or negative target I.D.'s are
                        ignored. The above restriction does not apply
                        to them.


  TARGNAME    1  CH*16  This is the target name. For target types 1 and
                        5, the name is used to define the target
                        position when the TGLOC is called by the
                        application program(RDCAT never calls TGLOC).

                        The target name is enclosed in single quotes, 
                        left justified(ie, no leading blanks).

                        See the notes on target names at the end of this
                        document.

  VARIABLE   DIM  TYPE  DESCRIPTION
  --------   ---  ----  -----------

  KTARGTYP    1   I*4   This indicates the type of target. Some targets
                        have their positions specified in the TARGDATA
                        array of this record.  Some target types are
                        directional only, others have position(ie, both
                        direction and distance).

                        Assignments:

                        < 1 Ignore this catalogue record. The record is
                            treated as though IDTARG were zero or 
                            negative.

                        = 1 Moving celestial target(sun, moon, planet,
                            comet, anti-solar point,.....). The target
                            has both direction and distance.


                        = 2 Earth-fixed target. Target has both
                            direction and distance.


                        = 3 Non-moving celestial target(star,...).
                            Target has direction only.


                        = 4 Target fixed in local orbital coordinates.
                            (examples: zenith, nadir, +/- orbit normal).
                            Target has direction only.


                        = 5 Noon or midnight zenith. The direction
                            defined by the vector from the earth center
                            to the spacecraft at the time computed by
                            the algorithm identified by the suffix 1 or
                            2 in the target name. The target has
                            direction only.

                            The user's program must sense the type, 
                            recognize the name NOONZENITHx or
                            MIDZENITHx(x=1 or 2)and compute the
                            position. The suffix in the target name
                            indicates how the target direction is
                            computed. In each case, the target is in
                            the orbit plane, but its longitude in the
                            plane may differ. The user's program can
                            call TGLOC to compute the location.
 
                            x= 1, zenith is half way in time between
                                  sunrise and sunset(noon zenith) or
                                  sunset and sunrise(midnight zenith)

                            x= 2, zenith is on the sun meridian(noon
                                  zenith) or opposite it(midnight
                                  zenith)

                            x= otherwise, an error. RDCAT will not
                                  sense the error, but TGLOC will.

                            horizon as seen from a satellite). Target
                            has both direction and distance.


                        = 7 A satellite. Target has both direction and 
                            distance.


                        = 8 Non-specific. Not a specific target, but 
                            allows the user's program to check 
                            constraints such as sunlight/shadow, 
                            SAA, etc.

  TARGDATA   AS   R*8   This is an array containing location and
            MANY        miscellaneous data.
             AS
           NEEDED       TARGDATA array elements are interpreted
                        according to the target type.  If data elements
                        are needed but not supplied, then RDCAT will
                        produce an error message and return no data
                        for that target.

   Comment:  This file description identifies information that must
             be present.  Additional information may be present and
             will be returned by RDCAT to the caller for non-standard
             use.  The program that calls RDCAT must give it enough
             array space to contain both the required and additional
             information.  RDCAT does error checks to verify that there
             is enough array space.



  TARGDATA CONTENTS DEPEND ON TARGET TYPE
  ---------------------------------------


    KTARGTYP = 1 (moving celestial target)

          No TARGDATA values are required.


    KTARGTYP = 2 (earth-fixed target)

          Four TARGDATA values are required.

          TARGDATA(1) = latitude(deg)
          TARGDATA(2) = longitude(deg, +=east)
          TARGDATA(3) = altitude above surface(km)
          TARGDATA(4) = sphere/ellipsoid flag

                         = 0., earth is spherical and latitude is 
                               geocentric
                         = otherwise, earth oblate and latitude is 
                               geodetic.

    KTARGTYP = 3 (fixed celestial target)

          Three TARGDATA values are required.

          TARGDATA(1) = right ascension, Mean of 1950.0
          TARGDATA(2) = declination, Mean of 1950.0
          TARGDATA(3) = flag indicating units in which angles are given

                        = 0., right ascension and declination are
                              in radians
                        = 1., right ascension and declination are
                              in degrees
                        = otherwise, right ascension is in hours,
                              minutes, seconds, and declination is in
                              degrees, minutes, and seconds;
                              formats are HHMMSS.SSS and +/-DDMMSS.SSS

            ( continuation of TARGDATA description )



    KTARGTYP = 4 (fixed in local orbital coords)


          Two TARGDATA values are required.

          TARGDATA(1) = azimuth(deg) from X-axis, positive toward +Y.
          TARGDATA(2) = elevation(deg), positive toward earth center.

          SPECIFIC:  zenith         az=   0.   el=  -90.
                     nadir          az=   0.   el=  +90.

                     neg orb norm   az=  90.   el=    0.

                (note that nadir direction is independent of
                      whether or not the earth is oblate)


    KTARGTYP = 5 (noon or midnight zenith)

          No TARGDATA values are required.


    KTARGTYP = 6 (horizon)


          Three TARGDATA values are required.

          TARGDATA(1) = azimuth, in local orbital coordinates, of a
                        vector from the satellite to the target.
                        Positive from X toward Y.  In degrees.

          TARGDATA(2) = target altitude above the edge of the disk as
                        seen from the satellite.  In kilometers.

          TARGDATA(3) = sphere/ellipsoid flag

                        = 0., earth is spherical
                        = otherwise, earth is oblate

                 ( continuation of TARGDATA description )

    KTARGTYP = 7 (the target is a satellite)

          The number of TARGDATA values required varies according to
          the contents of TARGDATA(1).

          RDCAT uses TARGDATA(1) to determine whether orbit
          parameters, an Ephem File unit number, or neither have been
          supplied in the remainder of the TARGDATA array.

          TARGDATA(1) = flag indicating the source of the target
                        satellite's location data.

               = 0, no info present about target satellite's orbit;
                    target name may be used by the application program
                    to compute the position, as would be done for
                    TDRS1 and TDRS2.
               = 1, target satellite's orbit info is in TARGDATA(2-10)
               = 2, target satellite's ephemeris information is on an
                    Ephem File; file's unit number is in TARGDATA(2)
               = otherwise, an error. RDCAT will produce an error
                    message and return no data for that target.


        SITUATION 1: TARGDATA(1) = 0.0

             Your program must provide its own code to get the target
             satellite's orbit information. TGLOC recognizes names TDRS1
             and TDRS2 and computes the location.

             One TARGDATA value is required.  Any addiditional
             parameters begin with TARGDATA(2).


        SITUATION 2: TARGDATA(1) = 1.0

             TARGDATA(2)   = Coordinate system(1=M50, 2=MDT, 3=TOD)

             TARGDATA(3)   = epoch for the initial conditions.
                             Format is YYMMDD.HHMMSS

             TARGDATA(4)   = orbital parameter type
                             (1=Keplerian, 2=Cartesian)

             -- WHEN TARGDATA(4) = 1 (ie, parameters are Keplerian)

                   TARGDATA(5-10) = sma, ecc, incl, node, argp,
                                    mean anom (kilometers, degrees)

             -- WHEN TARGDATA(4) = 2 (ie, parameters are Cartesian)

                   TARGDATA(5-10) = x, y, z, xdot, ydot, zdot  
                                      (km, km/sec)

             Ten TARGDATA values are required.  Any addiditional
             parameters begin with TARGDATA(11).


        SITUATION 3: TARGDATA(1) = 2.0

             TARGDATA(2) = Fortran unit number of target's Ephem File

             Two TARGDATA values are required.  Any addiditional
             parameters begin with TARGDATA(2).


    KTARGTYP = 8 (non-specific)

          No TARGDATA values are required.



***************************
*  NOTES ON TARGET NAMES  *
***************************



1. There is no error check for valid target names in the
   catalogue reader. Error checks are done by the target
   location package, TGLOC.


   
2. Target names may be repeated in the catalogue, but the
   id's may not be repeated. This may be useful when a
   target is a polygon and the target catalogue contains
   the vertices. A single name makes sense here. See the
   MYTOWN target in the example.
   


3. When using TGLOC, the following target names are reserved 
   within the target types indicated. 

   One can have a target target type 6 named SUN, 
   for example, and TGLOC will not interpret it 
   as the celestial body of the same name because 
   the name SUN is reserved only within target 
   type 1.


       NAME       TYPE
