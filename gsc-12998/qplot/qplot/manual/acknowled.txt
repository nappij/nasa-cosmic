                            Acknowledgments   


     QPLOT was written in conjuntion with the developement of the INCA
program.  INCA was developed for use on the VAX computer at Goddard
Space Flight Center by J. P. Downing (Old Dominion Systems, Inc.). The
control system engineer responsible for the acquisition and
development was F. H. Bauer (Code_712.3).  This project was carried
out by Old Dominion Systems under contract NAS5-27242 under the
direction of J. D. Azzolini (Code_712.1).  We want to thank A. H.
Forbes (ODS) for developing several terminal drivers and providing
valuable suggestions for further development.  In addition J. E.
French (ODS) supplied extensive rewrite and editorial services. We
also thank the other members of the Guidance and Control Branch
(Code_712) for their help, ideas, comments, and debugging aid.
