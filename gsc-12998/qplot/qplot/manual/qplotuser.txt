                            Abstract


     QPLOT is a device-independent, interactive graphics library for
the VAX computer.  While the system was designed around the graphics
capability of the Tektronix 4109 terminal, it has been implemented on
a range of terminals with widely differing capabilities.  In addition
to graphics, the QPLOT library provides complex math capabilities and
filters the user input for many commands, thus freeing the programmer
from implementing his own commands to control the QPLOT options. 

     The current version is written in Pascal for the VAX.  A number
of non-standard features of the VAX Pascal compiler were used, and
some effort will be required to convert the program to run on a
different machine.  All features used have Ada equivalents.

                     How to use the QPLOT manuals


     There are several manuals that describe the QPLOT system.  A list
of the subroutines and how they are called may be found in the QPLOT
Reference Manual (Volume 1).  The QPLOT User's manual (Volume 2)
describes the action of the commands that are implemented in the QPLOT
user input handler.  This manual may be incorporated into manuals for
application programs, either directly into the body, as an appendix,
or perhaps as a separate manual. 

     Additional manuals describing the various application programs
that use QPLOT will also be produced as needed.  For example, the
program WORM uses the QPLOT library to produce simple plots.  WORM
is described in Volume W1.

                            Acknowledgments   


     QPLOT was written in conjuntion with the developement of the INCA
program.  INCA was developed for use on the VAX computer at Goddard
Space Flight Center by J. P. Downing (Old Dominion Systems, Inc.). The
control system engineer responsible for the acquisition and
development was F. H. Bauer (Code_712.3).  This project was carried
out by Old Dominion Systems under contract NAS5-27242 under the
direction of J. D. Azzolini (Code_712.1).  We want to thank A. H.
Forbes (ODS) for developing several terminal drivers and providing
valuable suggestions for further development.  In addition J. E.
French (ODS) supplied extensive rewrite and editorial services. We
also thank the other members of the Guidance and Control Branch
(Code_712) for their help, ideas, comments, and debugging aid.

1   BUILTIN Commands Introduction
---------------------------------

     The library QPLOT is used for the creation of user-friendly,
device-independent, graphics-oriented programs.  There are routines to
handle most of a programmers I/O needs, both graphical and text
oriented.

     QPLOT also provides a number of commands that allow the user to
configure the graphics package to his needs and to provide useful
services such as access to HOST operating system commands, HELP
libraries, indirect file input, and Control-C interrupts.  These
commands are called builtin commands, and are available at all times.
All BUILTIN user commands must be spelled out in full, since all user
input is scanned for these commands.  Once a QPLOT user command is
completed, the prompt of the application program will be repeated.

     QPLOT is currently available on the VAX/VMS operating system
only.  The graphics can be displayed on the Tektronix 4014, 4106, 4109,
and 4114 and several other terminals.  Graphics commands can be
executed on any terminal, and batch capability is supported.
































                              Page   1

2   Input-Syntax
----------------

     QPLOT user input is handled by a set of common input routines.
These input routines always convert lowercase letters to uppercase
before use. There are routines to read a single character, character
strings, logical names, integers, real and complex numbers, and
answers to questions. Some special features of these routines are
described under the various topics.




2.1   special input
-------------------

     There are certain special input strings that are recognized by
QPLOT and converted to a context-sensitive values.  These inputs are:

DEFAULT     -- Each input query has a default value.  This is usually
               either the current value or sometimes a null or zero
               value.
LIMITS      -- If numeric input is expected, this string will cause
               the current input limits and default value to be
               printed.
NEGATE      -- If numeric input is expected, this string will be
               converted to the negative of the default value.  This
               string is not recognized for string input.
NULL        -- If string input is expected, this string will be
               converted to a string of zero length.  Note that if
               a string of zero length is entered, the default value
               will be used.
PI          -- If real numeric input (floating point) is expected,
               this string will cause the value of PI (3.14159...)
               to be given as the input string.
UNDEFINED   -- If real numeric input (floating point) is expected,
               this string will cause a special real value
               UNDEFINED to be assigned to the input string.




2.2   character
---------------

     Character input consists of a single ASCII character.  If more
than one character is entered before pressing return, the first
character is used.  If no characters are given, or if the string
"DEFAULT" is typed, the default character is used.




                              Page   2

2.3   question
--------------

     If there is a question expecting a yes/no answer, the first
character of the response is used as the answer. If this character is
"Y" (or "y") the answer given is interpreted as "yes". If this
character is "N" (or "n") the answer given is interpreted as "no".
Any other reponse will cause the question to be repeated.




2.4   string
------------

     String input consists of a string of zero or more ASCII
characters.  If no characters are given, or if the string "DEFAULT" is
typed, the default character is used.  If the string "NULL" is typed,
the null string (of length 0) is assumed.  Occaisionaly lower case
letters are allowed in string input, for example when titles or labels
are being entered.




2.5   logical name
------------------

     Logical name input is used for the entry of strings which must
contain no blanks, such as those used to name items that are later
used by a parsing routine.  A logical name consists of a string of
zero or more non-blank ASCII characters.  If no characters are given,
or if the string "DEFAULT" is typed, the default character is used.
If the string "NULL" is typed, the null string (of length 0) is
assumed.




2.6   integer
-------------

     Integer input is checked for proper format and compared to limits
before being accepted.  The proper format for an integer consists of
an optional sign ("+" or "-") and a string of digits.  No spaces are
allowed within this sequence. If the format is improper, a conversion
error is generated and the prompting message is repeated.

     Generally integer input is allowed only within certain limits --
If a number outside the range is entered, a message is generated and
the prompt is repeated.


                              Page   3


     If the user enters no data (only blanks and a carriage return),
the default value is used. The word "DEFAULT" may also be used to
select the default value, and the word "NEGATE" (or "NEG") may be used
to select the negative of the default value. The value of the limits
and the default value may be displayed by typing "LIMITS" (or "LIM")
instead of a numeric value.




2.7   real numbers
------------------

     Real number input is checked for proper format and compared to
limits before being accepted.  No spaces are allowed within this
sequence. If the format is improper, a conversion error is generated
and the prompting message is repeated.

     Often real input is allowed only within certain limits -- If a
number outside the range is entered, a message is generated and the
prompt is repeated.

     If the user enters no data (only blanks and a carriage return)
the default value is used. The word "DEFAULT" may also be used to
select the default value, and the word "NEGATE" (or "NEG") may be used
to select the negative of the default value. The value of the limits
and the default value may be displayed by typing "LIMITS" (or "LIM")
instead of a numeric value.

The proper format for a real number consists of:

          1)  An optional sign ("+" or "-")
          2)  A string of digits (a decimal point may be present)
          3)  An optional factor, consisting of
              3A)  A letter ("D", "d", "E", or "e")
              3B)  An optional sign ("+" or "-")
              3C)  A two-place string of digits





2.8   cursor-input
------------------

     Cursor input is used to activate commands that inspect and
manipulate a plot, so as not to spoil the image with extraneous
writing.  A single keystroke is used -- There is no need to hit the
<return> or <enter> key.



                              Page   4

     Many cursormode commands use the position of the graphics cursor
as additional input.  This might be a point on the plot to
be examined, the corner of a window for a zoom operation, or the
position at which to place a label.  If a non-graphics terminal is
being used, only the key pressed is signifcant.

     In batchmode cursor input is different.  The cursor position must
be entered as a pair of numbers.  Three input items are required,
separated by spaces.  These are:

          a)  Command, only first letter is significant.
          b)  X-position, an integer between 0 and 65535.
          c)  Y-position, an integer between 0 and 49151.








































                              Page   5

3   ABORT
---------

     The ABORT command will cause an error to be "created".  This
error has an error code of 000AB07T.  The effect is similar to an
overflow or other arithmetic error.  If the error handler is ON (it
should be except in unusual circumstances), the current command will
be terminated and control will return to the command level.  If the
error handler is OFF, all of the current activity will be abolished.
The error handler may be turned ON and OFF by using the
SET/ERROR_HANDLER command.

Format:
                 ABORT

     There are no parameters or inputs.  The ABORT command can be
given in response to any prompt.




































                              Page   6

4   HELP
--------

     The HELP command accesses the application program Help Library,
which is capable of providing an abundance of useful information about
the application program.  This library is organized in the same manner
as the VAX system help library.  Once a topic has been selected,
information about various sub-topics can be obtained by just entering
the name of the sub-topic.  If <RETURN> is given as a response to any
prompt, the help system moves up one level (from sub-topic to topic,
etc.) and eventually out of the Help Library.  If a topic (sub-topic)
is not found, a list of all available topics (subtopics) is given.

     Format:     HELP [topic] [sub-topic] [sub-sub-topic] ...

     The HELP command can be given in response to any prompt.  The
help library is also accesed if the "?" key is pressed while the QPLOT
menuing system is active (as indicated on the menu).



































                              Page   7

5   HOST
--------

      The HOST command allows access to the host command language.
For example, "HOST DIR" will likely generate a directory listing.

Format:
               HOST  [Host-command]

The HOST command can be given in response to any prompt.  The prompt
will be repeated after the HOST command is completed.










































                              Page   8

6   QPLOT
---------

     The QPLOT command place the user in the QPLOT command level,
where he receives the QPLOT> prompt.  The various qplot commands can
now be entered.  Alternatively, the user can type QPLOT followed by
the command that can be entered at the QPLOT command level.  In this
case that one command will be executed, and the original prompt will
be repeated.

     Format:     QPLOT  [qplot-command]

     The QPLOT command can be given in response to any prompt.








































                              Page   9

7   ATSIGN
----------

     This command transfers control of an applications program to a
file. Subsequent input will be read from the file indicated.  The
presence of this command in such a file will cause control to be
shifted to second file, and control will return to the first file upon
completion of the second file.  Files can be nested to a depth of
five, at which time an error message will be generated.

     Format:     @filename  parameters

     This command can be given in response to any prompt.




7.1   filename
--------------

     The filename is any valid VAX filespec, and thus may include
device names, directories, and subdirectories.  There is a default
extension of .SOU (source).

     Sample commands:

     @INCA
     @DUA1:[HISDIR.TEST]SAMPLE.SOU  TEST   45




7.2   parameters
----------------

     Up to nine paramters may be included following the filename, each
one separated by blanks.  These parameters will be used to substitute
for the strings 'Pn' in lines read from the source file.  All
occurances are substituted, and are done in numerical order.  The
string 'Pn' must be exactly correct, with a capital "P" and where
"n" is one of the digits from 1 to 9.




7.3   example
-------------

;   A file to change the size of the characters on a 4100 series terminal.
;   Note that semicolons indicate comments.

8   SEMICOLON
-------------

     This command does nothing.  The prompt is immediately repeated.
This command is most useful in command files to make comments.

     Format:     ; [comment]

     This command can be given as a response to any prompt.  The
prompt will be immediately repeated.











































                              Page  12

9   CONTROL-C
-------------

     The CONTROL-C command will cause an error to be "created".  This
error has an error code of 000EEEEE.  The effect is similar to an
overflow or other arithmetic error.  If the error handler is ON
(it should be except in unusual circumstances), the current command
will be terminated and control will return to the command level.  If the
error handler is OFF, all of the present run will be abolished.  The error
handler may be turned ON and OFF by using the SET/ERROR_HANDLER
command.

     To use the CONTROL-C command just press the CTRL and C keys at
the same time.  There are no parameters or inputs.  The CONTROL-C
command can be given at any time after the initialization phase.

10   QPLOT Commands Introduction
--------------------------------

     The QPLOT command level provides a number of commands that allow
the user to configure the graphics package to his needs, and also
setting the terminal type and pltting device.  QPLOT commands must be
given at the QPLOT prompt, or after the QPLOT builtin command is
given.













































                              Page  14

11   COLOR
----------

     QPLOT applications use different colors for different roles.
For instance the time might be displayed in red while the graphic
crosshairs might be shown in yellow.  These roles are called OBJECTS
in QPLOT.  The color assigned to objects can be changed using the
COLOR command.

     Format:      COLOR [/qualifier]  [object=color-1 [color-2] ...]

     If no qulaifier or parameter is specified, QPLOT will prompt for
the object and its new color assignment.  QPLOT recognizes all of
the named colors listed by the command COLOR /PRIMITIVE_COLORS.




11.1   Color Model
------------------

     Color definition and mixing is based on the hue-lightness-
saturation (HLS) color model. Each color is described by three
characteristics: hue, lightness, and saturation.  Hue is the basic
color, such as red, green, or blue-magenta. This characteristic varies
on a scale from 0 to 360 with blue at zero. Lightness varies from 0
(black) to 100 (white).  A value of 50 will allow the hue to be most
visible.  Saturation identifies the amount of color present, varying
from 0 (gray) to 100 (full color).  A value of 100 makes the colors
the brightest.  Some monochrome terminals display several shades of
gray.  On these terminals, one of the shades will be chosen to match a
given HLS value.




11.2   /LIST
------------

     This qualifier will print a list of graphic objects, all of which
are defined below, and the colors assigned to them by QPLOT.

     Format:  COLOR /LIST




11.3   /PRIMITIVE_COLORS
------------------------

     This qualifier will list the predefined colors in QPLOT with the


                              Page  15

HLS values that characterize them.  This list includes four
pseudo-colors which can be used in altering or combining these named
colors.  These are dark, light, clear, and blink.  The first two are
identical to black and white.  The second two are the absence of color
and are specified as if they were black, but have an attribute to
distinguish between clear (C) and blink (B).

     Format:  COLOR /PRIMITIVE_COLORS




11.4   Objects
--------------

     The object which can be set by the COLOR command include both
those listed below plus any defined by the application program.  Using
the COLOR/LIST command will list all objects currently defined.  The
use of non-QPLOT (those not listed here) objects should be given in
the application program documentation.




11.5   BOX
----------

     This object defines the color for the border around a graphic
display. For a monochrome terminal, the box will appear as a normal
line.  The default color is WHITE.

     Format:     COLOR  BOX=[color-1 ...]




11.6   CURSOR_1
---------------

     This object defines the color for the first cursor.  For a
monochrome terminal, the cursor will appear in the normal tint. Some
color terminals may not allow the user to change the cursor color, and
this command will have no effect.  The default color is RED.

     Format:     COLOR  CURSOR_1=[color-1 ...]








                              Page  16

11.7   CURSOR_2
---------------

     This object defines the color for the second cursor. The
cursor color alternates between the colors assigned to cursor 1 and
cursor 2.  To prevent this blinking effect, set the two colors the
same. For a monochrome terminal, the cursor will alternate between the
normal tint and black.  Some color terminals may not allow the user to
change the cursor color, and this command will have no effect.  The
default color is YELLOW.

     Format:     COLOR  CURSOR_2=[color-1 ...]




11.8   FILL
-----------

     This object defines the color of the area inside the box on a
two dimensional plot.  For a monochrome terminal the fill will NOT be
painted. The default color is DARK BLUE GRAY.

     Format:     COLOR  FILL=[color-1 ...]




11.9   GIN
----------

     This object defines the color for the crosshairs or graphics
input cursor. On some color terminals this color cannot be changed.

11.12   OVERBOX
---------------

     This object defines the color of the character cell in the
text overlay mode, if it is available on the terminal in use.  For a
monochrome terminal, the overbox will appear in clear or black.
The default color is CLEAR.

     Format:     COLOR  OVERBOX=[color-1 ...]




11.13   OVERCHAR
----------------

     This object defines the color for the characters printed in
the text overlay mode, if it is available on the terminal in use. For
a monochrome terminal, the characters will appear in their normal
tint.  The default color is LIGHT RED.

     Format:     COLOR  OVERCHAR=[color-1 ...]




11.14   PLOTBACK
----------------

     This object defines the color of the graphics background.  For

will be drawn as normal lines.  The default color is DARK GRAY GRAY.

     Format:     COLOR  SUBGRID=[color-1 ...]




11.16   TEXTBACK
----------------

     This object defines the color for the background in the text
mode. For a monochrome terminal and for color terminals which do not
have this color capability, the background will be black.  The default
color is DARK BLUE.

     Format:     COLOR  TEXTBACK=[color-1 ...]




11.17   TEXTBOX
---------------

     This object defines the color for the character cell in text
mode. For a monochrome terminal, the character cell will be clear or
black.  The default color is BLUE.

     Format:     COLOR  TEXTBOX=[color-1 ...]




11.18   TEXTCHAR
----------------

     This object defines the color of the characters printed in the
text mode.  For a monochrome terminal, the characters will appear in
their normal tint.  The default color is WHITE.

                              Page  20

12   FRAME
----------

     This command may be used to change QPLOT parameters that control
the construction of plotting frames.  The audit file, if implemented
for the application, will contain a status report on the changed
parameter.  If no argument is given, the user will be prompted to
enter a value.  Pressing <RETURN> will cause the current value to be
retained.  If no qualifier is given, the values of all frame
parameters will be listed.

     The quantity to be changed is given by the required qualifier.
The new value is given by the argument.  If the argument is omitted
or is incorrect you will be asked to enter the new value.  Just
pressing <RETURN> will then cause the old value to be retained.

     Format:     FRAME /qualifier [argument]




12.1   /EDITING
---------------

     This parameter controls the plotting frames that are currently
being edited by the FRAME, XFRAME, YFRAME and OBJECTFRAME commands.

     Format:     SET /EDITING  [frame-# [[,]frame-#]...]
     Default:    1




12.2   /AZIMUTH_PERCENT
-----------------------

     This parameter controls the percentage of the azimuthal grid that
is drawn in polar plots.

     Format:     SET /AZIMUTH_PERCENT  [integer-argument]
     Default:    65




12.3   /MAXTICKS
----------------

     This parameter controls the maximum number of major tick marks on
any border in X-Y plots.



                              Page  21

     Format:     SET /MAXTICKS  [integer-argument]

     Format:     SET /RADIAL_PERCENT  [integer-argument]
     Default:    65




12.5   /QUAREBOX
----------------

     This parameter controls whether the plotting window (white box)
will be forced to be square.  If this flag is on, the value of
the XFRAME/UPPER_LIMIT parameter is ignored.

     Format:     SET /QUAREBOX  [boolean-argument]
     Default:    ON




12.6   /SUB_TICKSIZE
--------------------

     This parameter controls the size of the minor (sub) tick marks
along the horizontal and vertical borders of the plot.  The range is 0
to 2000.

     Format:     SET /SUB_TICKSIZE  [integer-argument]
     Default:    640




12.7   /TICKSIZE
----------------

     This parameter controls the size of the major tick marks along
the horizontal and vertical borders of the plot.  The range is 480
to 4000.

                              Page  23

13   HARDCOPY
-------------

     This command is used to set and display the type of hardcopy
device being used.  Alterations can also be made to the plotting
routine parameters through this command.

     Format:     HARDCOPY [/qualifier]  [parameter]

     If the HARDCOPY command is given without a qualifier, the hardcopy
device currently selected will be listed.  If the /SETUP qualifier is
used, the user will be prompted for new parameters for the currenly
selected device.  If any other qualifier is used, the hardcopy device
will be changed to that given.  Descriptions are given under the
specific qualifiers.




13.1   /SETUP
-------------

      The hardcopy device driver can be given instructions to control
the size, orientation, and other characteristics of the plot. These
instructions are different for each type of plotting device. The user
will be asked questions to fully configure the previously selected
plotting device.  The variables which can be set with the qualifier
include plot mode density, plot size, and plot orientation.  Details
about use of these parameters is given in description of each specific
hard-copy device.

     In addition to the hardware-specific options, the Non-Local
Hardcopy Command File name must be given. This command file will take
the QPLOT generated file and output it to a device of the appropriate
type located on the user's VAX.  The QPLOT installer must generate
this command file for each hardcopy device that is available. For
example, the Versatec V-80 device might have a command file named
QPLOTHOME:VERV80.COM which includes routines and commands to direct
the file in the user's directory to that device.




13.2   /NONE
------------

     This qualifier signifies that no hard-copy device is connected to
the terminal.  It is used in batch-mode operation when the job may be
printed/plotted on a device selected by the system operator.

     Format:     HARDCOPY /NONE


                              Page  24





13.3   /LOCAL
-------------

     Use of this qualifier means that the terminal is connected
directly to a hard-copy device rather than the data stream being
routed through the computer to the device.  No parameter is provided
for identifying the particular printer/plotter.  If the LOCAL hardcopy
device is selected, device configuration (if necessary) is done using
the TERMINAL /SETUP command.

     Format:     HARDCOPY /LOCAL




13.4   Devices
--------------

     QPLOT contains drivers for the following plotters.  These devices
must be connected directly to the VAX, and preferably be used with a
queue.  Some devices may need special VAX software, known as a device
driver, to work properly.  It should be noted that the QPLOT software
for a particular graphics device may be (and often is) called a driver.
The device drivers mentioned here are lower level devices, and are
obtained from DEC or from the hardware manufacturer, and have nothing
to do with QPLOT.




13.5   /CI300
-------------

     Use of this qualifier means that the data stream is to be routed
to a C. Itoh Electronics (CIE) printer/plotter.  This is the same as
the low density mode of the CI600 printer/plotter.

     Format:     HARDCOPY /CI300

Use of the HARDCOPY /SETUP command when this device is selected will
allow the folling device specific parameters to be changed.








                              Page  25

13.5.1   Landscape / Portrait
-----------------------------

     In landscape format the plot will take up most of one sheet of
the paper. In portrait format the long length of the paper is in the
vertical direction.  This format can produce plots larger than the
landscape format, but they will be printed on more than on page of
paper.  This is the default orientation.




13.5.2   X size
---------------

     This command will set the number of pixels in the X or horizontal
direction.  The default value is 1268. The maximum value is 792 in
landscape orientation, and essentially unlimited in portrait
orientation.




13.5.3   Y size
---------------

     This command will set the number of pixels in the X or horizontal
direction.  The default value is 792. The maximum value is 792 in
portrait orientation, and essentially unlimited in landscape
orientation.




13.6   /PNX600
--------------

     Not yey fully implemented.




13.7   /TEK4510
---------------

     Use of this qualifier means that plot data is to be prepared in
Tektronix 4510 Color Raterizer format.  It is then directed to a
device of that type that is connected directly to the VAX.

     Format:     HARDCOPY /TEK4510



                              Page  26

Use of the HARDCOPY /SETUP command when this device is selected will
allow the folling device specific parameters to be changed.




13.7.1   Primary
----------------

     This the rpimary color option is selected, all colors to be
converted to one of the seven "primary" colors that can be printed by
the Tektronix printers without dithering. The colors include the four
ink colors (yellow, cyan, magenta, and black) and three mixtures (red,
green, and blue).  All other colors are "rounded" to one in this set.




13.7.2   Width
--------------

     This option controls the width of the lines on the plot.  Only
four values (1-4) are accepted, the rest have no effect.  A width of
one will produce very narrow lines, and is the factory default.  A
width of 4 will produce the widest lines, about one sixteenth of an
inch.




13.7.3   Copies
---------------

     This option controls the number of copies to be made of the
plot.  The maximum value is nine.  The plot is downloaded to the
Tek4510 unit only once.




13.7.4   Landscape / Portrait
-----------------------------

     If the plot is in landscape format the plot will be as large as
possible, and take up most of one sheet of the paper.  This is
normally the default orientation. In portrait format, where the long
length of the paper is in the vertical direction.  This format will
produce plots smaller in size.





                              Page  27

13.7.5   Text Style
-------------------

     This option controls whether stroke or string precision graphtext
is to be used.  See the Tek4510 manual for further details.




13.8   /VERV80
--------------

     Use of this qualifier means that plot data is to be prepared in
Versatec V-80 Series printer/plotter format.  It is then directed to a
device of that type that is connected directly to the VAX.  This
device will not work properly in queued mode without a special VAX
printer device driver, which can be obtained form Versatec.

     Format:     HARDCOPY /VERV80

Use of the HARDCOPY /SETUP command when this device is selected will
allow the folling device specific parameters to be changed.




13.8.1   Landscape / Portrait
-----------------------------

     If the flag is in landscape format, the plot will take up most of
one sheet of the paper. When in portrait format, where the long length
of the paper is in vertical direction.  This format can produce plots
larger than the landscape format, but they will be printed on more
than on page of paper.  This is the default orientation.




13.8.2   X size
---------------

     This command will set the number of pixels in the X or horizontal
direction.  The default value is 2816. The maximum value is 2112 in
landscape orientation, and essentially unlimited in portrait
orientation.








                              Page  28

13.8.3   Y size
---------------

     This command will set the number of pixels in the Y or vertical
direction.  The default value is 2112. The maximum value is 2112 in
portrait orientation, and essentially unlimited in landscape
orientation.














































                              Page  29

14   MENU
---------

     The MENU command controls whether the QPLOT menuing system is
activated.  The menus will appear if

        1)  The menuing system is active.
        2)  The terminal is ANSI-3.64 (VT100) compatible.
        3)  The terminal is in text mode.
        4)  No source file is active.

When menus are displayed the arrow keys can be used to move the cursor
among the various selections.  When the proper selection is reached,
just press <RETURN> to select that item.  Alternatively, just press
the key corresponding to item you wish to select.  The help library is
also accesed if the "?" key is pressed while the QPLOT menuing system
is active (as indicated on the menu).

     Format:     MENU [/qualifier] parameter




14.1   /DELAY
-------------

     This qualifier will change a value which is the wait after a
command is executed that produces screen output.  The parameter for
this command is the new value of the wait period in seconds.

     Format:     MENU /DELAY  [real-parameter]
     Default:    2.0




14.2   /PRESS
-------------

     This qualifier will change a flag which controls whether the user
is given the prompt "Press any key to continue" after a command is
exectuted that produces screen output.  The parameter for this command
is one of the strings "Y", "N", "YES", "N", "ON" or "OFF".

     Format:     MENU /PRESS  [boolean-parameter]
     Default:    OFF







                              Page  30

15   OBJECTFRAME
----------------

     This command may be used to change QPLOT parameters that control
the construction of plotting frames.  In particular, this command
controls the colors of the various objects in the frame.  The audit file, if imp
for the application, will contain a status report on the changed
parameter.  If no argument is given, the user will be prompted to
enter a value.  Pressing <RETURN> will cause the current value to be
retained.  If no qualifier is given, the values of all frame
parameters will be listed.

     The quantity to be changed is given by the required qualifier.
The new value is given by the argument.  The argument can be a color
or an object name.  If the argument is omitted or is incorrect you
will be asked to enter the new value.  Just pressing <RETURN> will
then cause the old value to be retained.

     Format:     FRAME /qualifier  [object|color]




15.1   /BOX
-----------

     This parameter controls the color of the box around the plot.

     Format:     OBJECTFRAME /BOX   [object|color]
     Default:    "BOX"




15.2   /FILL
------------

     This parameter controls the color of the fill in the plot area.

     Format:     OBJECTFRAME /FILL   [object|color]
     Default:    "FILL"




15.3   /GRID
------------

     This parameter controls the color of the main grid lines.

     Format:     OBJECTFRAME /GRID   [object|color]


                              Page  31

     Default:    "GRID"




15.4   /HEADING
---------------

     This parameter controls the color of the heading above the plot.

     Format:     OBJECTFRAME /HEADING   [object|color]
     Default:    "HEADING"




15.5   /NUMBER
--------------

     This parameter controls the color of the numbers around the plot.

     Format:     OBJECTFRAME /NUMBER   [object|color]
     Default:    "NUMBER"




15.6   /SUBGRID
---------------

     This parameter controls the color of the secondary grid lines.

     Format:     OBJECTFRAME /SUBGRID   [object|color]
     Default:    "SUBGRID"




15.7   /TICK
------------

     This parameter controls the color of the tick marks around the
plot.

                              Page  33

16   SET
--------

     This command may be used to change some QPLOT parameters.  The audit
file, if implemented for the application, will contain a status report
on the changed parameter.  If no argument is given, the user will be
prompted to enter a value.  Pressing <RETURN> will cause the current
value to be retained.  If no qualifier is given, the values of all
SETtable parameters will be listed.

     The quantity to be changed is given by the required qualifier.
The new value is given by the argument.  If the argument is omitted
or is incorrect you will be asked to enter the new value.  Just
pressing <RETURN> will then cause the old value to be retained.

     Format:     SET /qualifier [argument]




16.1   Character Sizes
----------------------

  In addition to the normal text displayed on the terminal in text
mode, QPLOT permits
construction of larger or smaller characters for uses such as legends on large
graphs.  Any character in the ASCII set may be drawn in this way.  The
SET command governs the size of these characters.  The qualifiers used
for this purpose are:

     HEIGHT
     CHAR_SPACING
     LINE_SPACING
     WIDTH

These are defined in their respective alphabetical order below.

The sum of the height and top margin by the sum of the width and right
margin defines the size of a cell for a constructed character.  The de-
fault size of a character cell is approximately 600 by 1000 units, where
the maximum size is approximately 3000 by 5000 units.  The size and number
of these units depends on the particular terminal.  The practical
minimum size of a cell is approximately 40 by 60 units which corresponds
to the size of usual characters at 80 characters per line.




16.2   /ASSIST
--------------



                              Page  34

     This parameter turns the assist flag on and off.  When the flag is
on, a "hint" is given before each line of user input, telling the user
what type of input is expected, and what the default is. Also, if
numeric input is expected, the minimum and maximum is given.

     Format:     SET /ASSIST  [boolean-argument]
     Default:    OFF




16.3   /CHAR_SPACING
--------------------

     This parameter controls the the margin between characters
when seen on the terminal display.  The initial value of this parameter is
approximately 100, but it depends upon the type of terminal.  This
quantity is reset to the initial value whenever the terminal type is
changed.  The user should not change this parameter if the terminal in
use is capable of displaying only one character size.

     Format:     SET /CHAR_SPACING  [integer-argument]
     Default:    terminal dependent




16.4   /DOTSIZE
---------------

     This parameter controls the size of the dots used when multiple
curves are displayed on a non-color terminal.  The initial value of
this parameter is approximately 64, but depends upon the type of
terminal.  It is 0 for a color terminal, for instance.  This quantity
is reset to the initial value whenever the terminal type is changed.
The range is 0 to 256.

     Format:     SET /DOTSIZE  [integer-argument]
     Default:    terminal dependent




16.5   /EQUIVALENCE
-------------------

     Sometimes the same command needs to be repeated several times. In
these cases it can be advantageous to teach QPLOT an abbreviation or
equivalence for the command.  This is done by using the SET




                              Page  35

16.5.1   EQUIVALENCE command.  All input lines are checked for this
-------------------------------------------------------------------
substitution. If several symbols are defined (the maximum is 50) the
last symbols are checked first.

     Format:     SET /EQUIVALENCE  equ-string=logical-string
     Default:    no equivalences defined




16.6   /FIELD_WIDTH
-------------------

     QPLOT prints real numbers with a certain width. The field width
is the number of characters per real number in the printout.

     Format:     SET /FIELD_WIDTH  [integer-argument]
     Default:    24




16.7   /HEIGHT
--------------

     This parameter controls the the height of characters within their
individual cells on the terminal display.  The initial value of this
parameter is approximately 800, but it depends upon the type of
terminal. This quantity is reset to the initial value whenever the
terminal type is changed.  The user should not change this parameter
if the terminal in use is capable of displaying only one character
size.

     Format:     SET /HEIGHT  [integer-argument]
     Default:    terminal dependent




16.8   /JOURNAL_FILE
--------------------

     This parameter turns the journal file on and off.  When the flag
is on, all user input is copied to the file named.  This file thus
forms a supplementary record of each entry.  A new journal file is
created each time this command is given a non-null filename. If the
filename is null (omitted), the current journal files is closed if
open and output is NOT written to any file.  The journal file can be
erased when no longer needed.  It can also be used to produce a file
for use with the ATSIGN command.


                              Page  36


     Format:     SET /JOURNAL_FILE  [filename-argument]
     Default:    no file active




16.9   /LINE_SPACING
--------------------

     This parameter controls the the spacing between lines of text on
the terminal display.  The initial value of this parameter is
approximately 200, but it depends upon the type of terminal.  This
quantity is reset to the initial value whenever the terminal type is
changed.  The user should not change this parameter if the terminal in
use is capable of displaying only one character size.

     Format:     SET /LINE_SPACING  [integer-argument]
     Default:    terminal dependent




16.10   /OVERLAY_KILL
---------------------

     This parameter controls whether the text overlay available on
certain terminals is turned off while plotting is being done.

     Format:     SET /OVERLAY_KILL  [boolean-argument]
     Default:    ON




16.11   /POST_ASSIST
--------------------

     This parameter turns the post_assist flag on and off.  When the flag
is on, a confirmation is given after all default input.  That is, if a
null string or the word "DEFAULT" is entered, QPLOT will tell the user
what value the program is using.

     Format:     SET /POST_ASSIST  [boolean-argument]
     Default:    OFF








                              Page  37

16.12   /RESOLUTION
-------------------

     This parameter controls the size of the fuzz area when graphic
input is being used.  The initial value of this parameter is
approximately 64, but depends upon the type of terminal.  This
quantity is reset to the initial value whenever the terminal type is
changed.  The range is 1 to 4096.

     Format:     SET /RESOLUTION  [integer-argument]
     Default:    terminal dependent




16.13   /WIDTH
--------------

     This parameter controls the the width of characters on the
terminal display.  The initial value of this parameter is
approximately 500, but it depends upon the type of terminal.  This
quantity is reset to the initial value whenever the terminal type is
changed.  The user should not change this parameter if the terminal in
use is capable of displaying only one character size.

     Format:     SET /WIDTH  [integer-argument]
     Default:    terminal dependent


























                              Page  38

17   SHOW
---------

     This command is used to display unsettable parameters in the
QPLOT system. Several qualifiers are available for this purpose. There
is no input for the SHOW command, since all required information is
given in the command line.  If no qualifier is given, the status
of most items is given, execpt ofr the commands, qualifiers, and the
terminal map.

     Format:     SHOW  [/qualifier]




17.1   /COMMANDS
----------------

     This qualifier displays the legal QPLOT internal commands.




17.2   /MAP_OF_TERMINALS
------------------------

     When an applications program is begun, QPLOT automatically
determines the device number and compares it to those in a terminal
map file. This file is usually maintained by the system manager and
contains a list a current device numbers and their type included in
the QPLOT system. If terminal to be used is not displayed correctly,
the system manager should be asked to correct the file.




17.3   /QUALIFIERS
------------------

     This qualifier displays the legal commands and associated
qualifiers.  The listing is taken from the QPLOT internal command
table and thus contains the latest revisions.




17.4   /SOURCE
--------------

     The value of the source flag may be examined using this
qualifier.  When a user logs onto the VAX through a terminal


                              Page  39

registered in the QPLOT Library, the source flag is set to TERM, which
indicates that the system is set for interactive use.  When data for
an applica- tion program is being input, such as by the ATSIGN
command, QPLOT set the source flag to COMMAND_FILE.  The source flag
is not set by any command specifically for that purpose alone.




17.5   /TIME
------------

     This qualifier will cause the current time and date to be
displayed.




17.6   /VERSION
---------------

     This qualifier will display the version of QPLOT used in the
compilation of the application program.






























                              Page  40

18   TERMINAL
-------------

     This command is used to change or display the terminal type.
If the qualifier is present, the terminal type will be changed.  If
the qualifier is not present, the terminal type will be displayed.

     Format:     TERMINAL [/qualifier]

     The QPLOT library used by these applications programs will
operate with several different types of terminals.  These include the
TEK4014, TEK4109, TEK4114, and VT100.  For a full list use the
SHOW/QUALIFIERS command to observe the possible qualifiers for the
TERMINAL command. Any of these may be used in the command to change
the terminal type.  Setup and use instructions for all of the
terminals are provided in the description of each terminal below.

     The type of terminal is written to the audit file and displayed
on the terminal.




18.1   /SETUP
-------------

      The terminal driver can be given instructions to control various
characteristics of the plot.  These instructions are different for
each type of terminal.  The user will be asked questions to fully
configure the previously plotting device.  The parameters set by the
user's answers are briefly described below.




18.2   /AUTO
------------

     This qualifier will compare the number of the device to be used
to those in a terminal map (QPLOTHOME:TERMINAL.MAP) file.  The
hardcopy device and plotter commands will also be set.  The map file
is usually maintained by the system manager and contains a list of
current device numbers and their types. If this terminal, or other
peripheral device, is not registered correctly, the system manager
should be asked to correct the file.








                              Page  41

18.3   /LOGICAL
---------------

     This qualifier will use a VAX defined logical name to find the
proper terminal type.  This can be useful if the user makes use of
several QPLOT applications during a single session.  Use the VAX
command DEFINE to create an equivalence for the logical name TERMINAL,
For example, $DEFINE TERMINAL TEK4014.  Afterwords you can use the
command QTERM/LOG to set the terminal type to TEK4014.




18.4   /QUERY
-------------

     This qualifier uses a feature of ANSI 3.64 standard terminals
(VT100 series) that requires the terminal to report its type
automatically when a certain escape sequence is sent.  QPLOT will then
examine the report and classify the terminal as a VT100, VT102, VT125,
VT220, or VT241.  If an no report is received after five seconds, or
an incorrect report is recieved, the type is changed to unknown, and
the procedure below is used.  Note that other types will also report,
for instance a TEK4109 will report itself to be a VT100, since it is
VT100 compatible.  Thus this temrinal type should only be used if the
user knows that the terminal is one of the above five.




18.5   /UNKNOWN
---------------

     If this terminal type is used, the computer will prompt the user
to type in his terminal type before the program can proceed.  The type
must match one the available types, or the prompt is repeated until it
does.  QPLOT commands are not available at the terminal type prompt.




18.6   /NONE
------------

     This qualifier will cancel all terminal output.  User input is
expected as usual.  The use of this qualifier in an interactive mode
is not recommended.  Its principal use is in batch mode.






                              Page  42

18.7   /DUMB
------------

     This qualifier will cancel all terminal-dependent output, such as
graphics commands.  The screen cannot be cleared.  Dumb terminals are
considered to have their own local graphic hardcopy device.  When a
hardcopy command is issued to this temrinal, a rough plot will be
produced using character cell graphics.  The user can use cursor input
by typing in the key, row, and column numbers.  This designation is
suitable for hardcopy terminals and others not supported by QPLOT.




18.8   /VT100
-------------

     This terminal is made by Digital Equipment Corporation, and is
the prototype of the ANSI 3.64 standard.  There are many clones of the
VT100, and many terminals or microcomputer programs claim to be
VT100-compatible.  Testing the features described below will determine
if the terminal is fully compatible.  A number of compatible terminals
are used at NASA-goddard and have been given separate names for
documentation purposes.  These are listed below.

     There are several differences between the way the VT100 graphics
mode and a real graphics terminal works.  The VT100 uses character
cell graphics.  This means it has a maximum practical resolution of 24
rows by 80 (or 132) columns. The VT100 does not have a joystick or
other cursor control device. The cursor is moved using the arrow keys
(The same ones used in EDT). The PF1-PF4 keys are used to make the
VT100 a little bit more usable. Their use is described below.

     PF1 flip-flops the VT100 from 80 column mode to 132 column mode
         and back again. The plot limits are automatically adjusted
         to take use all of the available screen space.

     PF2 flip-flops the plot characters from assorted characters
         (Used to represent the different colors available on a color
         graphics terminal such as the Tek4109) to all periods, and
         back again. This is useful when plotting a single curve.
         Using all periods tends to smooth the curve out.

     PF3 shows the dialog area. It does not return you to text mode,
         it just shows you the last five lines.

     PF4 is not used at the moment.

18.20   /TEK4106
----------------

     This terminal is made by Tektronix, Inc., and is totally
compatibile with the VT100 type, as far as QPLOT's commands are
concerned.  It is also capable of graphics, and in many ways is the
ideal terminal for QPLOT applications.

     The terminal must be configured as follows:

          GENERAL:     SNOOPY:                NO
          COMMUNICAT.: EOMCHARS:              CR LF (^M^J)
                       EOLSTRING:             'CR'  ('^M')
                       EOFSTRING:             'SB'  ('^Z')
                       BYPASSCANCEL:          LF    (^J)
          2PPI:        PASSIGN                P0: PPORT (If copy sent by VAX)
                                  or          P0: 4510 (If copy not sent by VAX)

Other setting may be adjusted as desired.

The TEK4106 terminal can be connected to (amomg others) a TEK4695
color printer and a TEK4510 rasterizer, which is in turn connected to
a printer.  Use of the QTERM/SETUP command when this terminal is
selected will allow the folling device specific parameters to be
changed.




18.20.1   Dialog Lines
----------------------

     The number of lines in the dialog area than can be quickly
displayed may vary, particularily when a terminal emulator is used.
This parameter will change the number of lines.




18.20.2   Hardcopy Device
-------------------------

     Either the TEK4695 printer (A), the TEK4510 rasterizer (B) or
none (Z) must be selected.




18.20.3   Tek4695 size
----------------------



                              Page  46

     If the TEK4695 hardcopy device is selected, this question will be
asked.  Large plots will fill the entire sheet in Landscape format.
Small plots are about 3 times smaller in portrait format.  The current
option allows the user to continue to use what ever size was
previously selected as remembered or setup inside the printer.




18.20.4   Tek4510 source
------------------------

     If the TEK4510 hardcopy device is selected, this question will be
asked.  If segment source is selected, the plotting data will be
dumped from the terminal's internal memory.  Segment source should be
used only if the TEK4107 or TEK4109 types is selected.  Vax source
should be used if the terminal has no segment memory, or it is bnot
being used.




18.20.5   Copy Needed
---------------------

     If the TEK4510 hardcopy device is selected, this question will be
asked.  The answer to this question depends upon how the 2PPI PASSIGN
parameter was set during the terminal setup (see above).  Incorrect
setting of this option will cause either two copies or no copies to be
generated.




18.20.6   Primary
-----------------

     If the TEK4510 hardcopy device is selected, this question will be
asked.  If the primary color option is selected, all colors to be
converted to one of the seven "primary" colors that can be printed by
the Tektronix printers without dithering. The colors include the four
ink colors (yellow, cyan, magenta, and black) and three mixtures (red,
green, and blue).  All other colors are "rounded" to one in this set.




18.20.7   Width
---------------

     If the TEK4510 hardcopy device is selected, this question will be


                              Page  47

asked.  This option controls the width of the lines on the plot.  Only
four values (1-4) are accepted, the rest have no effect.  A width of
one will produce very narrow lines, and is the factory default.  A
width of 4 will produce the widest lines, about one sixteenth of an
inch.




18.20.8   Copies
----------------

     If the TEK4510 hardcopy device is selected, this question will be
asked.  This option controls the number of copies to be made of the
plot.  The maximum value is nine.  The plot is downloaded to the
Tek4510 unit only once.




18.20.9   Landscape / Portrait
------------------------------

     If the TEK4510 hardcopy device is selected, this question will be
asked.  If the plot is in landscape format the plot will be as large
as possible, and take up most of one sheet of the paper.  This is
normally the default orientation. In portrait format, where the long
length of the paper is in the vertical direction.  This format will
produce plots smaller in size.




18.20.10   Text Style
---------------------

     If the TEK4510 hardcopy device is selected, this question will be
asked.  This option controls whether stroke or string precision
graphtext is to be used.  See the Tek4510 manual for further details.




18.21   /TEK4107
----------------

     This terminal is made by Tektronix, Inc., and is totally
compatibile with the TEK4106 type, and this QPLOT terminal driver
supports segment memory. The TEK4106 type may also be used if segment
memory is not needed.

18.22   /TEK4109
----------------

     This terminal is made by Tektronix, Inc., and is totally
compatibile with the TEK4106 type, and this QPLOT terminal driver
supports segment memory. The TEK4106 type may also be used if segment
memory is not needed.




18.23   /TGRAF
--------------

     This terminal emulator for the IBM-PC is made by GrafPoint, Inc.,
and is totally compatibile with the TEK4106 type, and this QPLOT
terminal driver supports segment memory. The TEK4106 type may also be
used if segment memory is not needed.  It is recommended that the
dialog lines be set to about 5 for this emulator.




18.24   /TEK4114
----------------

     This terminal is made by Tektronix, Inc., and is totally
compatibile with the TEK4014.  In addition, a number of additional
features are supported by QPLOT, including the dialog area.

     The terminal must be configured as follows:

          SNOOPY:                NO
          PAGEFULL:              NONE
          EOMCHARS:              CR LF (^M^J)
          EOLSTRING:             'CR'  ('^M')
          BYPASSCANCEL:          LF    (^J)

Other setting may be adjusted as desired.

18.30   /VDITERM
----------------

     This terminal type is an IBM-PC or compatible running the IBM
Graphics Terminal Emulator program.  This program emulates a
Lear-Siegler ADM-3A terminal in text mode and limited features of
a Tektronics 4105 terminal in graphics mode.  QPLOT will switch
modes as needed.  This program uses the IBM Virtual Device Interface,
and will run on all IBM standard graphics cards, but does not take
full advantage of and but the Color Graphics Adapter.

     The emulator must be configured as follows:

          DEVICE:                             Display
          TERMINAL:                           Graphics or Alpha
