 THERMAL ANALYSIS OF FLUID FLOW IN A PIPE

( BOEING CO. )

     Differential equations governing the thermal transient of fluid and
wall temperatures for flow in an exposed constant diameter pipe are devel-
oped.

     These equations are solved with an IBM 360 computer to obtain fluid and
wall temperatures for increments of pipe length at time increments during a
thermal transient.

     The computer program has the capability of solving heat transfer prob-
lems for fluid flow systems with a variable external thermal environment
for the pipe and variable inlet fluid temperature and flow rate.

     This item may be used for the heat transfer analysis of fluid flow sys-
tems with a variable external thermal environment for the pipe and variable
inlet fluid temperature and flow rate.

     Possible extensions include the analysis of vacuum-jacketed and insu-
lated piping systems. The techniques used could also be extended to include
the thermal analysis of exposed cryogenic piping systems during cooldown
and frost formation.
