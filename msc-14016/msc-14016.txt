 PROPULSION SIZING PROGRAM

( McDonnell Douglas Corp. )

     This program was written to evaluate and define optimum design parame-
ters and size of a low pressure auxiliary propulsion system (APS). The APS
will provide attitude and translational control, using gaseous hydrogen
and oxygen propellants for both the booster and orbiter elements of a NASA
Space Shuttle Vehicle.

     The program evaluates, for various space shuttle performance require-
ments, the optimum subsystem design parameters such as engine chamber pres-
sure, mixture ratio, expansion ratio, and component/subsystem weight and
size. The APS design point, sensitivities to design parameters, and mis-
sion requirements can be obtained quickly with the program.

     The documentation consists of two volumes. Volume I contains a com-
plete technical description of the APS including a description of subsystem
operation; subsystem/assembly design descriptions; delineation of the en-
gineering analysis equations, including substantiation of data; and sample
cases showing program input/output. Volume II contains a program descrip-
tion and internal program nomenclature including a description of variable
names and a detailed flow chart.

     The program could be revised to evaluate and optimize oxygen and hydro-
gen subsystem concepts for fuel cell and environmental control on space ve-
hicles.
