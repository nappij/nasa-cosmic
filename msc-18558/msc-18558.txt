 ORBITING SOLAR ARRAY SIMULATION MODEL

( ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP. )

     Solar arrays are becoming an increasingly important means of gener-
ating power for earth orbiting spacecraft. Currently, almost all unmanned
earth satellites utilize solar array electrical power generation systems.
Applications for solar arrays in the near future include providing power
for space shuttle payloads and manned space stations. This computer pro-
gram was developed to simulate the capabilities of earth orbiting arrays.
The model used is based on an improved version of a finite-element radiation
shape factor subprogram. The inherent simplicity and speed of the original
subprogram has been augmented with an improved shadow evaluation technique
to provide the user with an efficient array model.

     The program allows the characteristics of orbiting arrays to be evalu-
ated with a minimum of user effort and computer cost. Input to the program
consists of a brief description of the array and the orbital parameters.
The orbital parameters are used to determine the direct solar radiation in-
cident on the cells, incident solar radiation reflected to cells from the
earth, and the shadowing of any cells. Once the amount of thermal radiation
gained and lost by the array is known, the amount of power which can be gen-
erated and the temperature of the array is determined.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been
implemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with a central memory re-
quirement of approximately 76K (octal) of 60 bit words. Input is taken via
NAMELIST. This program was developed in 1979.
