 PITEST- MULTIPLE PRECISION ARITHMETIC

( STERLING )

     The PITEST program is a package of subroutines that perform arith-
metic on floating-point numbers of arbitrarily high precision. PITEST can
also work on very large integers by treating them as floating-point numbers
with enough precision to exactly represent their integral values. Multi-
precision computations are important in public key cryptography, Bessel
function round-off, and as integrity tests for scientific computer systems
(testing both hardware and FORTRAN compilers). PITEST calculates the value
of pi using the Borwein quadratically convergent algorithm of 1983 and the
quartically convergent algorithm obtained in 1985. PITEST is capable of
calculating pi to several billion digits, although the program as delivered
will calculate only 25,000 digits. This package also contains subroutines
to perform multiplication, division, and square root extraction using so-
phisticated techniques such as fast Fourier Transforms. Use of these sub-
routines can dramatically cut computational resources when high precision
arithmetic (over 400 digits) is required. This package includes single and
double precision versions of all subroutines.

     PITEST is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch execution and can be imple-
mented on any computer with 64 bit floating-point arithmetic (or 60 bits for
single precision). PITEST has been implemented on a CRAY-XMP supercomputer
under COS with a central memory requirement of approximately 160K of 64 bit
words. It has also run on an IBM PC with a math coprocessor. PITEST requires
a machine dependent clock timing subroutine. This program was developed in
1986.
