 FLUID- THERMODYNAMIC AND TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS

( NASA Lewis Research Center )

     The accurate computation of the thermodynamic and transport proper-
ties of fluids is a necessity for many engineering calculations. The FLUID
program was developed to calculate the thermodynamic and transport prop-
erties of pure fluids in both the liquid and gas phases. Fluid properties
are calculated using a simple gas model, empirical corrections, and an ef-
ficient numerical interpolation scheme. FLUID produces results that are
in very good agreement with measured values, while being much faster than
older more complex programs developed for the same purpose.

     A Van der Waals equation of state model is used to obtain approximate
state values. These values are corrected for real-gas effects by model cor-
rection factors obtained from tables based on experimental data. These ta-
bles also accurately compensate for the special circumstances which arise
whenever phase conditions occur. Viscosity and thermal conductivity val-
ues are computed directly from tables. Interpolation within tables is
based on Lagrange's three point formula. A set of tables must be generated
for each fluid implemented.

     FLUID currently contains tables for nine fluids including dry air and
steam. The user can add tables for any fluid for which adequate thermal
property data is available. The FLUID routine is structured so that it may
easily be incorporated into engineering programs.

     The IBM 360 version of FLUID was developed in 1977. It is written in
FORTRAN IV and has been implemented on an IBM 360 with a central memory re-
quirement of approximately 222K of 8 bit bytes. The IBM PC version of FLUID
is written in Microsoft FORTRAN 77 and has been implemented on an IBM PC with
a memory requirement of 128K of 8 bit bytes. The IBM PC version of FLUID was
developed in 1986.
