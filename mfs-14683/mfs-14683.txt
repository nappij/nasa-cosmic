 COMPRESSIBLE FLOW COMPUTER PROGRAM

( NORTH AMERICAN AVIATION, INC. )

     This program solves problems involving compressible pipe flow with
heat transfer through the use of an electrical analogy. To adapt the con-
tainer data for program usage, the container surfaces are assigned node
numbers.

     To balance the system to a specified pressure drop, one of two com-
pressible flow solutions can be used: the flow can be fixed and the orifice
diameters adjusted or orifice sizes fixed and the flow corrected.

     Solving for manifold design parameters, the fixed flow routine is
first used to determine approximate orifice sizes and flow rates. Con-
tainer inlet temperature values are compared with the required tempera-
tures and final adjustments are made on the variable flow routine to yield
design values for orifice size, flow and temperature.

     This program has been implemented on the 7094.
